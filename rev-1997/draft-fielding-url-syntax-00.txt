Abstract

   A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a compact string representation
   of the location for a resource that is available via the Internet.
   This document defines the general syntax and semantics of URLs,
   including both absolute and relative locators, and guidelines for
   their use and for the definition of new URL schemes.  It revises and
   replaces the generic definitions in RFC 1738 and RFC 1808.


1. Introduction

   Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) provide a simple and extensible
   means for identifying a resource by its location.  This specification
   of URL syntax and semantics is derived from concepts introduced by
   the World Wide Web global information initiative, whose use of such
   objects dates from 1990 and is described in "Universal Resource
   Identifiers in WWW", RFC 1630 [1].  The specification of URLs is
   designed to meet the recommendations laid out in "Functional
   Recommendations for Internet Resource Locators", RFC 1736 [8].

   This document updates and merges RFC 1738 "Uniform Resource Locators"
   [2] and RFC 1808 "Relative Uniform Resource Locators" [7] in order to
   define a single, general syntax for all URLs.  It excludes those
   portions of RFC 1738 that defined the specific syntax of individual
   URL schemes; those portions will be updated as separate documents.

   URLs are characterized by the following definitions:

      Uniform
         Uniformity of syntax and semantics allows the mechanism for
         referencing resources to be independent of the mechanism used
         to locate those resources and the operations applied to those
         resources once they have been located.  New types of resources,
         access mechanisms, and operations can be introduced without
         changing the protocols and data formats that use URLs.

      Resource
         A resource can be anything that has identity.  Familiar
         examples include an electronic document, an image, a service
         (e.g., "today's weather report for Los Angeles"), and a
         collection of other resources.  Not all resources are network
         "retrievable", such as human beings, corporations, and actual
         books in a library.

         The resource is the conceptual entity defined by the identity,
         not necessarily the thing which holds that identity at one
         particular instance in time.  Thus, a resource can remain
         constant even when its content---the thing(s) to which it
         currently corresponds---changes over time, provided that the
         identity is not changed in the process.

      Locator
         A locator is an object that identifies a resource by its
         location.  In the case of URLs, the object is a sequence of
         characters with a restricted syntax.  An absolute locator
         identifies a location independent of any context, whereas a
         relative locator identifies a location relative to the
         context in which it is found.

   URLs are used to `locate' resources by providing an abstract
   identification of the resource location.  Having located a resource,
   a system may perform a variety of operations on the resource, as
   might be characterized by such words as `access', `update',
   `replace', or `find attributes'.  This specification is only
   concerned with the issue of identifying a resource by its location.

1.1. Example URLs

   The following examples illustrate URLs which are in common use.

   ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1808.txt
      -- ftp scheme for File Transfer Protocol services

   gopher://spinaltap.micro.umn.edu/00/Weather/California/Los%20Angeles
      -- gopher scheme for Gopher and Gopher+ Protocol services

   http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/
      -- http scheme for Hypertext Transfer Protocol services

   mailto:masinter@parc.xerox.com
      -- mailto scheme for electronic mail addresses

   news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix
      -- news scheme for USENET news groups and articles

   telnet://melvyl.ucop.edu/
      -- telnet scheme for interactive services via the TELNET Protocol

   Many other URL schemes have been defined.  Section 7 describes how
   new schemes are defined and registered.  Although many URL schemes
   are named after protocols, this does not imply that the only way to
   access the URL's resource is via the named protocol.  Gateways,
   proxies, caches, and name resolution services might be used to access
   some resources, independent of the protocol of their origin.

1.2. URL Transcribability

   The URL syntax has been designed to promote transcribability over all
   other concerns.  A URL is a sequence of characters, i.e., letters,
   digits, and special characters.  A URL may be represented in a
   variety of ways: e.g., ink on paper, pixels on a screen, or a
   sequence of octets in a coded character set.  The interpretation of a
   URL depends only on the identity of the characters used.

   The goal of transcribability can be described by a simple scenario.
   Imagine two colleagues, Sam and Kim, sitting in a pub at an
   international conference and exchanging research ideas.  Sam asks Kim
   for a location to get more information, so Kim writes the URL for the
   research site on a napkin.  Upon returning home, Sam takes out the
   napkin and types the URL into a computer, which then retrieves the
   information to which Kim referred.

   There are several design concerns revealed by the scenario:

      o  A URL is a sequence of characters, which is not always
         represented as a sequence of octets.

      o  A URL may be transcribed from a non-network source, and thus
         should consist of characters which are most likely to be able
         to be typed into a computer, within the constraints imposed by
         keyboards (and related input devices) across nationalities and
         languages.

      o  A URL often needs to be remembered by people, and it is easier
         for people to remember a URL when it consists of meaningful
         components.

   These design concerns are not always in alignment.  For example, it
   is often the case that the most meaningful name for a URL component
   would require characters which cannot be typed on most keyboards.
   In such cases, the ability to access a resource is considered more
   important than having its URL consist of the most meaningful of
   components.

1.3. Syntax Notation and Common Elements

   This document uses two conventions to describe and define the syntax
   for Uniform Resource Locators.  The first, called the layout form, is
   a general description of the order of components and component
   separators, as in

      <first>/<second>;<third>?<fourth>

   The component names are enclosed in angle-brackets and any characters
   outside angle-brackets are literal separators.  Whitespace should be
   ignored.  These descriptions are used informally and do not define
   the syntax requirements.

   The second convention is a BNF-like grammar, used to define the
   formal URL syntax.  The grammar is that of RFC 822 [6], except that
   "|" is used to designate alternatives.  Briefly, rules are separated
   from definitions by an equal "=", indentation is used to continue a
   rule definition over more than one line, literals are quoted with "",
   parentheses "(" and ")" are used to group elements, optional elements
   are enclosed in "[" and "]" brackets, and elements may be preceded
   with <n>* to designate n or more repetitions of the following
   element; n defaults to 0.

   Unlike many specifications which use a BNF-like grammar to define the
   bytes (octets) allowed by a protocol, the URL grammar is defined in
   terms of characters.  Each literal in the grammar corresponds to the
   character it represents, rather than to the octet encoding of that
   character in any particular coded character set.  How a URL is
   represented in terms of bits and bytes on the wire is dependent upon
   the character encoding of the protocol used to transport it, or the
   charset of the document which contains it.

   The following definitions are common to many elements:

      alpha    = lowalpha | hialpha

      lowalpha = "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i" |
                 "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r" |
                 "s" | "t" | "u" | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z"

      hialpha  = "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" | "H" | "I" |
                 "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N" | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" |
                 "S" | "T" | "U" | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z"

      digit    = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" |
                 "8" | "9"

      alphanum = alpha | digit

   The complete URL syntax is collected in Appendix A.


2. URL Characters and Character Escaping

   All URLs consist of a restricted set of characters, chosen to
   maximize their transcribability and usability across varying computer
   systems, natural languages, and nationalities.  This restricted set
   corresponds to a subset of the graphic printable characters of the
   US-ASCII coded character set [10].

   The set of characters allowed for use within URLs can be described in
   three categories: reserved, unreserved, and escaped.

      urlchar     = reserved | unreserved | escaped

2.1. Reserved Characters

   Many URLs include components consisting of, or delimited by, certain
   special characters.  These characters are called "reserved", since
   their usage within the URL component is limited to their reserved
   purpose.  If the data characters for a URL component would conflict
   with the reserved purpose, then the conflicting characters must be
   escaped before forming the URL.
   
      reserved    = ";" | "/" | "?" | ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+"

   This specification uses the "reserved" set to refer to those
   characters which are allowed within a URL, but which may not be
   allowed within a particular component of the generic URL syntax; they
   are used as delimiters of the components described in Section 4.

   Characters in the "reserved" set are not always reserved.  The set of
   characters actually reserved within any given URL component is
   defined by that component.  In general, a character is reserved if
   escaping that character would change the semantics of the URL.

2.2. Unreserved Characters

   Data characters which are allowed in a URL but do not have a reserved
   purpose are called unreserved.  These include upper and lower case
   letters, decimal digits, and a subset of the punctuation marks and
   symbols found in US-ASCII.

      unreserved  = alpha | digit | mark

      mark        = "$" | "-" | "_" | "." | "!" | "~" |
                    "*" | "'" | "(" | ")" | ","

   Unreserved characters can be escaped without changing the semantics
   of the URL, but this should not be done unless the URL is being used
   in a context which does not allow the unescaped character to appear.

2.3. Escaped Characters

   A character needs to be escaped if it is non-printable, if it is
   often used to delimit a URL from its context, if it is not found in
   the US-ASCII coded character set, if it is known to cause problems
   when passed through some e-mail gateways, or if it is being used as
   normal data within a component in which it is reserved.
   
2.3.1. Escaped Encoding

   An escaped character is encoded as a character triplet, consisting of
   the percent character "%" followed by the two hexadecimal digits
   representing the character's octet code in an 8-bit coded character
   set.  For example, "%20" is the escaped encoding for the space
   character.
   
      escaped     = "%" hex hex
      hex         = digit | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" |
                            "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f"

   The 8-bit coded character set of the octet must be a superset of the
   US-ASCII coded character set, such that the US-ASCII characters have
   the same escaped encoding regardless of the larger octet character
   set.  The coded character set chosen must correspond to the character
   set of the mechanism that will interpret the URL component in which
   the escaped character is used.
   
2.3.2. When to Escape and Unescape

   A URL is always in an escaped form, since escaping or unescaping a
   completed URL might change its semantics.  The only time that
   characters within a URL can be safely escaped is when the URL is
   being created from its component parts.  Each component may have its
   own set of characters which are reserved, so only the mechanism
   responsible for generating or interpreting that component can
   determine whether or not escaping a character will change its
   semantics.  Likewise, a URL must be separated into its components
   before the escaped characters within those components can be
   safely unescaped.

   Because the percent "%" character always has the reserved purpose of
   being the escape indicator, it must be escaped as "%25" in order to
   be used as data within a URL.  Implementers should be careful not to
   escape or unescape the same string more than once, since unescaping
   an already unescaped string might lead to misinterpreting a percent
   data character as another escaped character, or vice versa in the
   case of escaping an already escaped string.

2.3.3. Excluded Characters

   Although they are not used within the URL syntax, we include here a
   description of those characters which have been excluded and the
   reasons for their exclusion.

      excluded    = control | space | delims | unwise | national

   All characters corresponding to the control characters in the
   US-ASCII coded character set are unsafe to use within a URL, both
   because they are non-printable and because they are likely to be
   misinterpreted by some control mechanisms.

      control     = <US-ASCII coded characters 00-1F and 7F hexadecimal>

   The space character is excluded because significant spaces may
   disappear and insignificant spaces may be introduced when URLs are
   transcribed or typeset or subjected to the treatment of
   word-processing programs.  Whitespace is also used to delimit URLs in
   many contexts.
   
      space       = <US-ASCII coded character 20 hexadecimal>

   The angle-bracket "<" and ">" and double-quote (`"') characters are
   excluded because they are often used as the delimiters around URLs in
   text documents and protocol fields.  The character "#" is excluded
   because it is used to delimit a URL from a fragment identifier in URL
   references.  The percent character "%" is excluded because it is used
   for the encoding of escaped characters.

      delims      = "<" | ">" | "#" | "%" | <">
   
   Other characters are excluded because gateways and other transport
   agents are known to sometimes modify such characters.

      unwise      = "{" | "}" | "|" | "\" | "^" | "[" | "]" | "`"

   Finally, all other characters besides those mentioned in the above
   sections are excluded because they are often difficult or impossible
   to transcribe using traditional computer keyboards and software.

      national    = <Any character not in the reserved, unreserved,
                     control, space, delims, or unwise sets>

   Excluded characters must be escaped in order to be properly
   represented within a URL.  However, there do exist some systems that
   allow characters from the "unwise" and "national" sets to be used in
   URL references; a robust implementation should be prepared to handle
   those characters when it is possible to do so.


3. URL References

   A common source of confusion in the use and interpretation of Uniform
   Resource Locators is the distinction between a reference to a URL and
   the URL itself.  A URL reference may be absolute or relative, and may
   be attached to additional information in the form of a fragment
   identifier.  However, "the URL" which results from such a reference
   includes only the absolute URL after the fragment identifier (if any)
   is removed and after any relative URL is resolved to its absolute
   form.  Although it is possible to limit the discussion of URL syntax 
   and semantics to that of the absolute result, most usage of URLs
   is within general URL references, and it is impossible to obtain the
   URL from such a reference without also parsing the fragment and
   resolving the relative form.

      URL-reference  =  [ absoluteURL | relativeURL ] [ "#" fragment ]

   The syntax for relative URLs is a shortened form of that for absolute
   URLs, where some prefix of the URL is missing and certain path
   components ("." and "..") have a special meaning when interpreting a
   relative path.

   When a URL reference is used to perform a retrieval action on the
   identified resource, the optional fragment identifier, separated from
   the URL by a crosshatch ("#") character, consists of additional
   reference information to be interpreted by the user agent after the
   retrieval action has been successfully completed.  As such, it is not
   part of a URL, but is often used in conjunction with a URL.  The
   format and interpretation of fragment identifiers is dependent on the
   media type of the retrieved resource.

      fragment  =  *urlchar

   A URL reference which does not contain a URL is a reference to the
   current document.  In other words, an empty URL reference within a
   document is interpreted as a reference to the top of that document,
   and a reference containing only a fragment identifier is a reference
   to the identified fragment of that document.  Traversal of such a
   reference should not result in an additional retrieval action.

   When parsing a URL reference, the fragment identifier (if any) is
   extracted first.  If the reference contains a crosshatch "#"
   character, then the substring after the first (left-most) crosshatch
   and up to the end of the parse string is the fragment identifier.  If
   the crosshatch is the last character, or no crosshatch is present,
   then the fragment identifier is empty.  The crosshatch separator is
   discarded.


4. Generic URL Syntax

4.1. Scheme

   Just as there are many different methods of access to resources,
   there are a variety of schemes for describing the location of such
   resources.  The URL syntax consists of a sequence of components
   separated by reserved characters, with the first component defining
   the semantics for the remainder of the URL string.

   In general, absolute URLs are written as follows:

      <scheme>:<scheme-specific-part>

   An absolute URL contains the name of the scheme being used (<scheme>)
   followed by a colon (":") and then a string (the <scheme-specific-
   part>) whose interpretation depends on the scheme.

   Scheme names consist of a sequence of characters.  The lower case
   letters "a"--"z", digits, and the characters plus ("+"), period
   ("."), and hyphen ("-") are allowed.  For resiliency, programs
   interpreting URLs should treat upper case letters as equivalent to
   lower case in scheme names (e.g., allow "HTTP" as well as "http").

      scheme  =  1*( alpha | digit | "+" | "-" | "." )

   When parsing a URL reference, the scheme (if any) is extracted after
   the fragment.  If the reference contains a colon ":" after the first
   character and before any characters not allowed as part of a scheme
   name, the scheme of the URL is the substring of characters up to, but
   not including, the first colon.  The colon separator is discarded.

   Relative URL references are distinguished from absolute URLs in that
   they do not begin with a scheme name.  Instead, the scheme is
   inherited from the base URL, as described in Section 7.

4.2. Opaque and Hierarchical URLs

   The URL syntax does not require that the scheme-specific-part have
   any general structure or set of semantics which is common among all
   URLs.  However, a subset of URLs do share a common syntax for
   representing hierarchical relationships within the locator namespace.
   This generic-URL syntax is used in interpreting relative URLs.

      absoluteURL = generic-URL | opaque-URL

      opaque-URL  = scheme ":" *urlchar

      generic-URL = scheme ":" relativeURL

   It is often the case that a group or "tree" of documents has been
   constructed to serve a common purpose; the vast majority of URLs in
   these documents point to locations within the tree rather than
   outside of it.  Similarly, documents located at a particular server
   are much more likely to refer to other resources on that server than
   to resources at remote sites.

   Relative addressing of URLs allows document trees to be partially
   independent of their location and access scheme.  For instance, it is
   possible for a single set of hypertext documents to be simultaneously
   accessible and traversable via each of the "file", "http", and "ftp"
   schemes if the documents refer to each other using relative URLs.
   Furthermore, such document trees can be moved, as a whole, without
   changing any of the relative references.  Experience within the WWW
   has demonstrated that the ability to perform relative referencing
   is necessary for the long-term usability of embedded URLs.

      relativeURL = net_path | abs_path | rel_path

      net_path    = "//" server [ abs_path ]
      abs_path    = "/"  rel_path
      rel_path    = [ path ] [ ";" parameters ] [ "?" query ]

   It is not necessary for all URLs within a given scheme to be
   restricted to the generic-URL syntax, since the hierarchical
   properties of that syntax are only necessary when relative URLs are
   used within a particular document.  Documents can only make use of
   relative URLs when their base URL fits within the generic-URL syntax.
   It is assumed that any document which contains a relative reference
   will also have a base URL that obeys the syntax.  In other words,
   relative URLs cannot be used within documents that have unsuitable
   base URLs.

   URLs which are hierarchical in nature use the slash "/" character for
   separating hierarchical components.  For some file systems, the "/"
   used to denote the hierarchical structure of a URL corresponds to the
   delimiter used to construct a file name hierarchy, and thus the URL
   path will look similar to a file pathname.  This does NOT imply that
   the URL is a Unix pathname.

4.3. URL Syntactic Components

   The URL syntax is dependent upon the scheme.  Some schemes use
   reserved characters like "?" and ";" to indicate special components,
   while others just consider them to be part of the path.  However,
   most URL schemes use a common sequence of five main components to
   define the location of a resource

      <scheme>://<server>/<path>;<parameters>?<query>

   each of which, except <scheme>, may be absent from a particular URL.

   The order of the components is important.  If both <parameters> and
   <query> are present, the <query> information must occur after the
   <parameters>.  A URL reference is parsed into its components from the
   outside-in: fragment, scheme, server, query, parameters, and then
   path.

4.3.1. Server Component

   URL schemes that involve the direct use of an IP-based protocol to a
   specified host on the Internet use a common syntax for the server
   component of the URL's scheme-specific data:

        <user>:<password>@<host>:<port>

   Some or all of the parts "<user>:<password>@", ":<password>", and
   ":<port>" may be excluded.  The server component is preceded by a
   double slash "//" and is terminated by the next slash "/" or by the
   end of the URL.  The different components obey the following rules:

      server         = [ [ user [ ":" password ] "@" ] hostport ]

      user           = *[ unreserved | escaped |
			  ";" | "?" | "&" | "=" | "+" ]

      password       = *[ unreserved | escaped |
			  ";" | "?" | "&" | "=" | "+" ]

   The user name (and password), if present, are followed by a
   commercial at-sign "@".  Within the user and password fields, the
   characters ":", "@", and "/" are reserved.

   Note that an empty user name or password is different than no user
   name or password; there is no way to specify a password without
   specifying a user name.  E.g., <ftp://@host.com/> has an empty
   user name and no password, <ftp://host.com/> has no user name,
   while <ftp://foo:@host.com/> has a user name of "foo" and an
   empty password.

      hostport     = host [ ":" port ]
      host         = hostname | hostnumber
      hostname     = *( domainlabel "." ) toplabel
      domainlabel  = alphanum | alphanum *( alphanum | "-" ) alphanum
      toplabel     = alpha | alpha *( alphanum | "-" ) alphanum
      hostnumber   = 1*digit "." 1*digit "." 1*digit "." 1*digit
      port         = *digit

   The host is a domain name of a network host, or its IP address as a
   set of four decimal digit groups separated by ".".  Fully qualified
   domain names take the form as described in Section 3.5 of RFC 1034
   [9] and Section 2.1 of RFC 1123 [5]: a sequence of domain labels
   separated by ".", each domain label starting and ending with an
   alphanumerical character and possibly also containing "-" characters.
   The rightmost domain label will never start with a digit, though,
   which syntactically distinguishes all domain names from the IP
   addresses.

   The port is the network port number for the server.  Most schemes
   designate protocols that have a default port number.  Another port
   number may optionally be supplied, in decimal, separated from the
   host by a colon.  If the port is omitted, the default port number is
   assumed.

   When parsing a URL reference, the server component (if any) is
   extracted after the scheme.  If the remaining reference begins with a
   double-slash "//", then the substring of characters after the
   double-slash and up to, but not including, the next slash "/"
   character is the server component of the URL.  If no trailing slash
   is present, the entire remaining reference is the server component.
   The double-slash separator is discarded.

4.3.2. Path Component

   The path component contains data specific to the scheme or server.
   It typically specifies the details of how the resource can be
   accessed.  Note that the "/" between the host (or port) and the
   url-path is NOT part of the url-path.

      path        = fsegment *( "/" segment )
      fsegment    = 1*pchar
      segment     =  *pchar

      pchar       = unreserved | escaped | ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+"

   When parsing a URL reference, the path is extracted after all other
   components.  The remaining reference is the URL path and the slash
   "/" that might precede it.  Although the initial slash is not part of
   the URL path, the parser must remember whether or not it was present
   so that later processes can differentiate between relative and
   absolute paths, as described in Section 7.

   Authors should be aware that path names which contain a colon ":"
   character cannot be used as the first component of a relative URL
   path (e.g., "this:that") because they will likely be mistaken for a
   scheme name.  It is therefore necessary to precede such cases with
   other components (e.g., "./this:that") in order for them to be
   referenced as a relative path.

4.3.3. Parameters Component

   The parameters component is a sequence of semi-colon-separated
   attributes.

      parameters  = param *( ";" param )
      param       = *( pchar | "/" )

   When parsing a URL reference, the parameters component (if any) is
   extracted after the query component.  If the remaining reference
   contains a semicolon ";" character, then the substring after the
   first (left-most) semicolon and up to the end of the reference is the
   parameters component.  If the semicolon is the last character, or no
   semicolon is present, then the parameters component is empty.  The
   semicolon separator is discarded.

4.3.4. Query Component

   The query component is a string of information to be interpreted by
   the resource.

      query       = *urlchar

   When parsing a URL reference, the query component (if any) is
   extracted after the server component.  If the remaining reference
   contains a question mark "?" character, then the substring after the
   first (left-most) question mark and up to the end of the reference is
   the query component.  If the question mark is the last character, or
   no question mark is present, then the query component is empty.  The
   question mark separator is discarded.


5. Establishing a Base URL

   The term "relative URL" implies that there exists some absolute "base
   URL" against which the relative reference is applied.  Indeed, the
   base URL is necessary to define the semantics of any relative URL
   reference; without it, a relative reference is meaningless.  In order
   for relative URLs to be usable within a document, the base URL of
   that document must be known to the parser.

   The base URL of a document can be established in one of four ways,
   listed below in order of precedence.  The order of precedence can be
   thought of in terms of layers, where the innermost defined base URL
   has the highest precedence.  This can be visualized graphically as:

      .----------------------------------------------------------.
      |  .----------------------------------------------------.  |
      |  |  .----------------------------------------------.  |  |
      |  |  |  .----------------------------------------.  |  |  |
      |  |  |  |   (5.1) Base URL embedded in the       |  |  |  |
      |  |  |  |         document's content             |  |  |  |
      |  |  |  `----------------------------------------'  |  |  |
      |  |  |   (5.2) Base URL of the encapsulating entity |  |  |
      |  |  |         (message, document, or none).        |  |  |
      |  |  `----------------------------------------------'  |  |
      |  |   (5.3) URL used to retrieve the entity            |  |
      |  `----------------------------------------------------'  |
      |   (5.4) Base URL = "" (undefined)                        |
      `----------------------------------------------------------'

5.1. Base URL within Document Content

   Within certain document media types, the base URL of the document can
   be embedded within the content itself such that it can be readily
   obtained by a parser.  This can be useful for descriptive documents,
   such as tables of content, which may be transmitted to others through
   protocols other than their usual retrieval context (e.g., E-Mail or
   USENET news).

   It is beyond the scope of this document to specify how, for each
   media type, the base URL can be embedded.  It is assumed that user
   agents manipulating such media types will be able to obtain the
   appropriate syntax from that media type's specification.  An example
   of how the base URL can be embedded in the Hypertext Markup Language
   (HTML) [3] is provided in Appendix B.

   Messages are considered to be composite documents.  The base URL of a
   message can be specified within the message headers (or equivalent
   tagged metainformation) of the message.  For protocols that make use
   of message headers like those described in MIME [4], the base URL
   can be specified by the Content-Base or Content-Location header
   fields.

      Content-Base      = "Content-Base" ":" absoluteURL

      Content-Location  = "Content-Location" ":"
                          ( absoluteURL | relativeURL )

   The field names are case-insensitive and any whitespace inside
   the field value (including that used for line folding) is ignored.
   Content-Base takes precedence over any Content-Location.  If the
   latter is relative, it must be resolved to its absolute form (like
   any relative URL) before it can be used as the base URL for other
   references.

   For example, the header field

      Content-Base: http://www.ics.uci.edu/Test/a/b/c

   would indicate that the base URL for that message is the string
   "http://www.ics.uci.edu/Test/a/b/c".  The base URL for a message
   serves as both the base for any relative URLs within the message
   headers and the default base URL for documents enclosed within the
   message, as described in the next section.

   Protocols which do not use the RFC 822 message header syntax, but
   which do allow some form of tagged metainformation to be included
   within messages, may define their own syntax for defining the base
   URL as part of a message.

5.2. Base URL from the Encapsulating Entity

   If no base URL is embedded, the base URL of a document is defined by
   the document's retrieval context.  For a document that is enclosed
   within another entity (such as a message or another document), the
   retrieval context is that entity; thus, the default base URL of the
   document is the base URL of the entity in which the document is
   encapsulated.

   Composite media types, such as the "multipart/*" and "message/*"
   media types defined by MIME (RFC 1521, [4]), define a hierarchy of
   retrieval context for their enclosed documents.  In other words, the
   retrieval context of a component part is the base URL of the
   composite entity of which it is a part.  Thus, a composite entity can
   redefine the retrieval context of its component parts via the
   inclusion of a Content-Base or Content-Location header, and this
   redefinition applies recursively for a hierarchy of composite parts.
   Note that this might not change the base URL of the components, since
   each component may include an embedded base URL or base-header that
   takes precedence over the retrieval context.

5.3. Base URL from the Retrieval URL

   If no base URL is embedded and the document is not encapsulated
   within some other entity (e.g., the top level of a composite entity),
   then, if a URL was used to retrieve the base document, that URL shall
   be considered the base URL.  Note that if the retrieval was the
   result of a redirected request, the last URL used (i.e., that which
   resulted in the actual retrieval of the document) is the base URL.

5.4. Default Base URL

   If none of the conditions described in Sections 5.1 -- 5.3 apply,
   then the base URL is considered to be the empty string and all
   URL references within that document are assumed to be absolute URLs.

   It is the responsibility of the distributor(s) of a document
   containing relative URLs to ensure that the base URL for that
   document can be established.  It must be emphasized that relative
   URLs cannot be used reliably in situations where the document's base
   URL is not well-defined.


6. Resolving Relative URLs

   This section describes an example algorithm for resolving URL
   references within a context in which the URLs may be relative, such
   that the result is always a URL in absolute form.  Although this
   algorithm cannot guarantee that the resulting URL will equal that
   intended by the original author, it does guarantee that any valid URL
   (relative or absolute) can be consistently transformed to an absolute
   form given a valid base URL.

   The following steps are performed in order:

   Step 1: The base URL is established according to the rules of
           Section 5.  If the base URL is the empty string (unknown),
           the URL reference is interpreted as an absolute URL and
           we are done.

   Step 2: Both the base and URL reference are parsed into their
           component parts as described in Section 4.

           a) If the URL reference is entirely empty, or consists only
              of a fragment identifier, it is interpreted as a reference
              to the current document and we are done.

           b) If the URL reference starts with a scheme name, it is
              interpreted as an absolute URL and we are done.

           c) Otherwise, the URL reference inherits the scheme of
              the base URL.

   Step 3: If the URL reference's <server> is non-empty, we skip to
           Step 7.  Otherwise, the URL reference inherits the <server>
           (if any) of the base URL.

   Step 4: If the URL reference path is preceded by a slash "/", the
           path is not relative and we skip to Step 7.

   Step 5: If the URL reference path is empty (and not preceded by a
           slash), then the URL reference inherits the base URL path,
           and

           a) if the URL reference's <parameters> is non-empty, we skip
              to step 7; otherwise, it inherits the <parameters> of the
              base URL (if any) and

           b) if the URL reference's <query> is non-empty, we skip to
              step 7; otherwise, it inherits the <query> of the base
              URL (if any) and we skip to step 7.

   Step 6: The last segment of the base URL's path (anything
           following the rightmost slash "/", or the entire path if no
           slash is present) is removed and the URL reference's path is
           appended in its place.  The following operations are
           then applied, in order, to the new path:

           a) All occurrences of "./", where "." is a complete path
              segment, are removed.

           b) If the path ends with "." as a complete path segment,
              that "." is removed.

           c) All occurrences of "<segment>/../", where <segment> is a
              complete path segment not equal to "..", are removed.
              Removal of these path segments is performed iteratively,
              removing the leftmost matching pattern on each iteration,
              until no matching pattern remains.

           d) If the path ends with "<segment>/..", where <segment> is a
              complete path segment not equal to "..", that
              "<segment>/.." is removed.

   Step 7: The resulting URL components, including any inherited from
           the base URL, are recombined to give the absolute form of
           the URL reference.

   Parameters, regardless of their purpose, do not form a part of the
   URL path and thus do not affect the resolving of relative paths.  In
   particular, the presence or absence of the ";type=d" parameter on an
   ftp URL does not affect the interpretation of paths relative to that
   URL.

   The above algorithm is intended to provide an example by which the
   output of implementations can be tested -- implementation of the
   algorithm itself is not required.  For example, some systems may find
   it more efficient to implement Step 6 as a pair of segment stacks
   being merged, rather than as a series of string pattern matches.
   Further examples are provided in Appendix C.


7. Adding New Schemes

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains a registry
   of URL schemes.

   The current process for defining URL schemes is via the Internet
   standards process: new URL schemes should be described in
   standards-track RFCs.  Over time, other methods of registering URL
   schemes may be added.

   URL schemes must have demonstrable utility and operability.  One way
   to provide such a demonstration is via a gateway which provides
   objects in the new scheme for clients using an existing protocol.  If
   the new scheme does not locate resources that are data objects, the
   properties of names in the new space must be clearly defined.

   URL schemes should follow the same syntactic conventions of existing
   schemes when appropriate.  URL schemes should use the generic-URL
   syntax if they are intended to be used with relative URLs.  A
   description of the allowed relative forms should be included in the
   scheme's definition.


8. Security Considerations

   The URL scheme does not in itself pose a security threat.  Users
   should beware that there is no general guarantee that a URL which at
   one time points to a given object continues to do so, and does not
   even at some later time point to a different object due to the
   movement of objects on servers.

   A URL-related security threat is that it is sometimes possible to
   construct a URL such that an attempt to perform a harmless idempotent
   operation such as the retrieval of the object will in fact cause a
   possibly damaging remote operation to occur.  The unsafe URL is
   typically constructed by specifying a port number other than that
   reserved for the network protocol in question.  The client
   unwittingly contacts a server which is in fact running a different
   protocol.  The content of the URL contains instructions which, when
   interpreted according to this other protocol, cause an unexpected
   operation.  An example has been the use of gopher URLs to cause a rude
   message to be sent via a SMTP server.  Caution should be used when
   using any URL which specifies a port number other than the default
   for the protocol, especially when it is a number within the reserved
   space.

   Care should be taken when URLs contain escaped delimiters for a given
   protocol (for example, CR and LF characters for telnet protocols)
   that these are not unencoded before transmission.  This would violate
   the protocol but could be used to simulate an extra operation or
   parameter, again causing an unexpected and possible harmful remote
   operation to be performed.

   The use of URLs containing passwords that should be secret is clearly
   unwise.

B. Recommendations for Delimiting URLs in Context

   URIs, including URLs, are intended to be transmitted through
   protocols which provide a context for their interpretation.

   In some cases, it will be necessary to distinguish URLs from other
   possible data structures in a syntactic structure.  In this case, is
   recommended that URLs be preceded with a prefix consisting of the
   characters "URL:".  For example, this prefix may be used to
   distinguish URLs from other kinds of URIs.

   In addition, there are many occasions when URLs are included in other
   kinds of text; examples include simple plain text sent in electronic
   mail, USENET news messages, or, most importantly, printed on paper.
   In such cases, it is important to be able to delimit the URL from the
   rest of the text, and in particular from punctuation marks that might
   be mistaken for part of the URL.

   In practice, URLs are delimited in a variety of ways, using brackets
   [http://test.com/] or angle brackets <http://www.w3.org> or even
   paired braces {http://test.com}, with or (usually) without the "URL:"
   prefix.  This wrapper does not form part of the URL.  In the case
   where a fragment/anchor identifier is associated with a URL
   (following a "#"), the identifier would be placed within the brackets
   as well.

   In some cases, extra whitespace (spaces, linebreaks, tabs, etc.) may
   need to be added to break long URLs across lines.  The whitespace
   should be ignored when extracting the URL.

   No whitespace should be introduced after a hyphen ("-") character.
   Because some typesetters and printers may (erroneously) introduce a
   hyphen at the end of line when breaking a line, the interpreter of a
   URL containing a line break immediately after a hyphen should ignore
   all unencoded whitespace around the line break, and should be aware
   that the hyphen may or may not actually be part of the URL.

   Examples:

      Yes, Jim, I found it under <ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/doc;
      type=d> but you can probably pick it up from <ftp://ds.in
      ternic.net/rfc>.  Note the warning in <http://ds.internic.
      net/instructions/overview.html#WARNING>.


C. Examples of Resolving Relative URLs

   Within an object with a well-defined base URL of

      Content-Base: http://a/b/c/d;p?q

   the relative URLs would be resolved as follows:

C.1.  Normal Examples

      g:h           =  g:h
      g             =  http://a/b/c/g
      ./g           =  http://a/b/c/g
      g/            =  http://a/b/c/g/
      /g            =  http://a/g
      //g           =  http://g
      ?y            =  http://a/b/c/d;p?y
      g?y           =  http://a/b/c/g?y
      g?y/./x       =  http://a/b/c/g?y/./x
      #s            =  http://a/b/c/d;p?q#s
      g#s           =  http://a/b/c/g#s
      g#s/./x       =  http://a/b/c/g#s/./x
      g?y#s         =  http://a/b/c/g?y#s
      ;x            =  http://a/b/c/d;x
      g;x           =  http://a/b/c/g;x
      g;x?y#s       =  http://a/b/c/g;x?y#s
      .             =  http://a/b/c/
      ./            =  http://a/b/c/
      ..            =  http://a/b/
      ../           =  http://a/b/
      ../g          =  http://a/b/g
      ../..         =  http://a/
      ../../        =  http://a/
      ../../g       =  http://a/g

C.2.  Abnormal Examples

   Although the following abnormal examples are unlikely to occur in
   normal practice, all URL parsers should be capable of resolving them
   consistently.  Each example uses the same base as above.

   An empty reference refers to the top of the current document.

      <>            =  http://a/b/c/d;p?q

   Parsers must be careful in handling the case where there are more
   relative path ".." segments than there are hierarchical levels in the
   base URL's path.  Note that the ".." syntax cannot be used to change
   the <server> of a URL.

      ../../../g    =  http://a/../g
      ../../../../g =  http://a/../../g

   Similarly, parsers must avoid treating "." and ".." as special when
   they are not complete components of a relative path.

      /./g          =  http://a/./g
      /../g         =  http://a/../g
      g.            =  http://a/b/c/g.
      .g            =  http://a/b/c/.g
      g..           =  http://a/b/c/g..
      ..g           =  http://a/b/c/..g

   Less likely are cases where the relative URL uses unnecessary or
   nonsensical forms of the "." and ".." complete path segments.

      ./../g        =  http://a/b/g
      ./g/.         =  http://a/b/c/g/
      g/./h         =  http://a/b/c/g/h
      g/../h        =  http://a/b/c/h

   Finally, some older parsers allow the scheme name to be present in a
   relative URL if it is the same as the base URL scheme.  This is
   considered to be a loophole in prior specifications of partial URLs
   [1] and should be avoided by future parsers.

      http:g        =  http:g
      http:         =  http:


D. Embedding the Base URL in HTML documents

   It is useful to consider an example of how the base URL of a document
   can be embedded within the document's content.  In this appendix, we
   describe how documents written in the Hypertext Markup Language
   (HTML) [3] can include an embedded base URL.  This appendix does not
   form a part of the relative URL specification and should not be
   considered as anything more than a descriptive example.

   HTML defines a special element "BASE" which, when present in the
   "HEAD" portion of a document, signals that the parser should use the
   BASE element's "HREF" attribute as the base URL for resolving any
   relative URLs.  The "HREF" attribute must be an absolute URL.  Note
   that, in HTML, element and attribute names are case-insensitive.  For
   example:

      <!doctype html public "-//IETF//DTD HTML//EN">
      <HTML><HEAD>

E. Summary of Non-editorial Changes

E.1. Additions

   Section 1 (Introduction) is entirely new.  Design rationale for the
   scope of URLs and the chosen URL character set has been added in
   order to address common misconceptions about what would and would not
   be appropriate for additional URL schemes, and why the allowed
   character set is limited to US-ASCII characters.

   Section 3 (URL References) was added to stem the confusion regarding
   "what is a URL" and how to describe fragment identifiers given that
   they are not part of the URL, but are part of the URL syntax and
   parsing concerns.  In addition, it provides a reference definition
   for use by other IETF specifications (HTML, HTTP, etc.) which have
   previously attempted to redefine the URL syntax in order to account
   for the presence of fragment identifiers in URL references.

   Section 2.3.2 (When to Escape and Unescape) was added in response to
   many (mis)implementation questions on the subject.

E.2. Modifications from both RFC 1738 and RFC 1808

   Confusion regarding the terms "character encoding", the URL
   "character set", and the escaping of characters with %<hex><hex>
   equivalents has (hopefully) been reduced.  Many of the BNF rule names
   regarding the character sets have been changed to more accurately
   describe their purpose and to encompass all "characters" rather than
   just US-ASCII octets.  Unless otherwise noted here, these
   modifications do not affect the URL syntax.

   Both RFC 1738 and RFC 1808 refer to the "reserved" set of characters
   as if URL-interpreting servers were limited to a single set of
   characters with a reserved purpose (i.e., as meaning something other
   than the data to which the characters correspond), and that this set
   was fixed by the URL scheme.  However, this has not been true in
   practice; any character which is interpreted differently when it is
   escaped is, in effect, reserved.  Furthermore, the interpreting
   engine on a server is often dependent on the resource, not just the
   URL scheme.  The description of reserved characters has been changed
   accordingly.

   The plus "+" character was added to those in the "reserved" set,
   since it is treated as reserved within some URL components.

   The tilde "~" character was added to those in the "unreserved" set,
   since it is extensively used on the Internet in spite of the
   difficulty to transcribe it with some keyboards.

E.3. Modifications from RFC 1738

   The definition of specific URL schemes and their scheme-specific
   syntax and semantics has been moved to separate documents.

   The URL host was defined as a fully-qualified domain name.  However,
   many URLs are used without fully-qualified domain names (in contexts
   for which the full qualification is not necessary), without any host
   (as in some file URLs), or with a host of "localhost".

   The URL port is now *digit instead of 1*digit, since systems are
   expected to handle the case where the ":" separator between host and
   port is supplied without a port.

E.4. Modifications from RFC 1808

   RFC 1808 (Section 4) defined an empty URL reference (a reference
   containing nothing aside from the fragment identifier) as being a
   reference to the base URL.  Unfortunately, that definition could be
   interpreted, upon selection of such a reference, as a new retrieval
   action on that resource.  Since the normal intent of such references
   is for the user agent to change its view of the current document to
   the beginning of the specified fragment within that document, not to
   make an additional request of the resource, a description of how to
   correctly interpret an empty reference has been added in Section 3.

   The description of the mythical Base header field has been replaced
   with the Content-Base and Content-Location header fields defined by
   HTTP/1.1 and MHTML.

   RFC 1808 described various schemes as either having or not having the
   properties of the generic-URL syntax.  However, the only requirement
   is that the particular document containing the relative references
   have a base URL which abides by the generic-URL syntax, regardless of
   the URL scheme, so the associated description has been updated to
   reflect that.

   The BNF term <net_loc> has been replaced with <server>, since the
   latter more accurately describes its use and purpose.
