<H1>URL specification update area</H1>

I am working on a revision of RFC 1738 (Uniform Resource Locators)
and RFC 1808 (Relative Uniform Resource Locators).  This is my active
work area, so don't be surprised if the documents change rapidly.

<P>The work is progressing as follows:

<OL>
<LI>I grabbed the current set of URL RFCs and removed the header/footer
    garbage that makes diff comparisons difficult.
<LI>I created a base document (a copy of the original content of RFC 1738
    and RFC 1808) which merges the two specs without changing any of the
    effective content, except in that all of the scheme-specific definitions
    are removed.  This base document will be useful for doing diffs of the
    actual specification changes (as opposed to just the editorial changes
    of moving paragraphs around and changing section titles).  I will need
    to make parallel updates to this document whenever I make non-content
    changes to the new url spec.
<LI>I am currently working on the new url spec.
</OL>
