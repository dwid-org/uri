<H1>URL specification update area</H1>

I am working on a revision of RFC 1738 (Uniform Resource Locators)
and RFC 1808 (Relative Uniform Resource Locators).  This is my active
work area, so don't be surprised if the documents change rapidly.

<P>The work is progressing as follows:

<OL>
<LI>I grabbed the current set of URL RFCs and removed the header/footer
    garbage that makes diff comparisons difficult.
<LI>I created a base document (a copy of the original content of RFC 1738
    and RFC 1808) which merges the two specs without changing any of the
    effective content, except in that all of the scheme-specific definitions
    are removed.  I was going to use it for diffs, but the extent of
    editorial changes necessary to really merge the two specs makes that
    impossible.
<LI>The <a href="draft-fielding-url-syntax-00.txt">first complete draft</a>
    is available.  Changes are noted in the last appendix.
<LI>I have created three test pages for relative URL parsing, parts
    <a href="test1.html">one</a>, <a href="test2.html">two</a>, and
    <a href="test3.html">three</a>, 
    and have tested a few common browsers.  I need more testers.  If all
    (or almost all) of the browsers do things differently than the spec,
    and it isn't an obvious bug in those browsers, then the spec will
    need to change.
<LI>My working copy of the <a href="url.txt">new url spec</a> is also
    available, but may change at any time.
    Changes are noted in the last appendix.
</OL>
