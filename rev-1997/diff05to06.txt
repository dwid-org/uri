+    While the rules for resolving partial/relative URLs since the have

+ 
+    Because of the ambiguity, such relative forms should be avoided.

     Some parsers allow the scheme name to be present in a relative URL
     if it is the same as the base URL scheme.  This is considered to be
     a loophole in prior specifications of partial URLs [RFC1630]. Its
