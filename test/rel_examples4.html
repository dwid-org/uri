<H1>Examples of Resolving Relative URLs, Part 4</H1>

This document has an embedded base URL of

in order to test a notion that Tim Berners-Lee mentioned regarding
the ability of URIs to have a triple-slash (or even more slashes)
to indicate higher levels of hierarchy than those already used by URLs.

<H3>Synopsis</H3>

RFC 1808 specified that the highest level for relative URLs is indicated
by a double-slash "//", and therefore that any triple-slash would be
considered a null site component, rather than a higher-level component
than the site component (as proposed by Tim).<P>

Draft 09 assumes that a triple-slash means an empty site component.
Netscape Navigator behaves irrationally, apparently because their parser
is scheme-dependent and therefore doesn't do the hierarchical parsing that
would be expected.  Oddly, Lynx seems to straddle both sides.
