<H1>Examples of Resolving Relative URLs, Part 4</H1>

This document has an embedded base URL of
<PRE>
   Content-Base: fred:///s//a/b/c
</PRE>
in order to test a notion that Tim Berners-Lee mentioned regarding
the ability of URIs to have a triple-slash (or even more slashes)
to indicate higher levels of hierarchy than those already used by URLs.
<P>
I will need your help testing the examples on multiple browsers. 
What you need to do is point to the example anchor and compare it to the
resolved URL in your browser (most browsers have a feature by which you
can see the resolved URL at the bottom of the window/screen when the anchor
is active).
<P>
Please send your test results to

<H3>Synopsis</H3>

RFC 1808 specified that the highest level for relative URLs is indicated
by a double-slash "//", and therefore that any triple-slash would be
considered a null server component, rather than a higher-level component
than the server component (as proposed by Tim).<P>

Draft D3 assumes that a triple-slash means an empty server component.
Netscape Navigator behaves irrationally, apparently because their parser
is scheme-dependent and therefore doesn't do the hierarchical parsing that
would be expected.  Oddly, Lynx seems to straddle both sides.
