<h1>Examples of Resolving Relative URIs</h1>

<p>This document has an embedded base URI of</p>
<pre>
   http://a/b/c/d;p?q
</pre>
<p>the relative URIs should be resolved as shown below.</p>
<p>
I will need your help testing the examples on multiple browsers. 
What you need to do is point to the example anchor and compare it to the
resolved URI in your browser (most browsers have a feature by which you
can see the resolved URI at the bottom of the window/screen when the anchor
is active).</p>

<h2>Abnormal Examples</h2>

<p>Although the following abnormal examples are unlikely to occur in
normal practice, all URI parsers should be capable of resolving them
consistently.  Each example uses the same base as above.</p>

<p>Parsers must be careful in handling cases where there are more
relative path ".." segments than there are hierarchical levels in the
base URI's path.  Note that the ".." syntax cannot be used to change
the authority component of a URI.</p>
<pre>
<a href="../../../g">../../../g</a>    =  http://a/g               [R,X,1,3,6]
                 http://a/../g            [2,4,5]

<a href="../../../../g">../../../../g</a> =  http://a/g               [R,X,1,3,6]
                 http://a/../../g         [2,4,5]
</pre>
<p>Similarly, parsers must remove the dot-segments "." and ".." when
they are complete components of a path, but not when they are only
part of a segment.
</p>
<pre>
<a href="/./g">/./g</a>      =  http://a/g                   [R,1,6]
             http://a/./g                 [X,2,3,4,5]

<a href="/../g">/../g</a>     =  http://a/g                   [R,1,6]
             http://a/../g                [X,2,3,4,5]

<a href="g.">g.</a>        =  http://a/b/c/g.              [R,X,1,2,3,4,5,6]

<a href=".g">.g</a>        =  http://a/b/c/.g              [R,X,1,2,3,4,5,6]

<a href="g..">g..</a>       =  http://a/b/c/g..             [R,X,1,2,3,4,5,6]

<a href="..g">..g</a>       =  http://a/b/c/..g             [R,X,1,2,3,4,5,6]
</pre>
<p>Less likely are cases where the relative URI reference uses unnecessary or
nonsensical forms of the "." and ".." complete path segments.</p>

<a href="./../g">./../g</a>     =  http://a/b/g                [R,X,1,2,5,6]

              http://a/b/c/g              [3,4]

<a href="g/./h">g/./h</a>      =  http://a/b/c/g/h            [R,X,1,2,3,4,5,6]

<a href="g/../h">g/../h</a>     =  http://a/b/c/h              [R,X,1,2,3,4,5,6]

<a href="g;x=1/./y">g;x=1/./y</a>  =  http://a/b/c/g;x=1/y        [R,X,1,2,3,4,6]
              http://a/b/c/g;x=1/./y      [5]

<a href="g;x=1/../y">g;x=1/../y</a> =  http://a/b/c/y              [R,X,1,2,3,4,6]
              http://a/b/c/g;x=1/../y     [5]

</pre>
<p>Some applications fail to
separate the reference's query and/or fragment components from a
relative path before merging it with the base path and removing dot-segments.
This error is rarely noticed, since typical usage of a fragment never
includes the hierarchy ("/") character, and the query component is not
normally used within relative references.</p>
<pre>
<a href="g?y/./x">g?y/./x</a>    =  http://a/b/c/g?y/./x        [R,X,5,6]

<a href="g?y/../x">g?y/../x</a>   =  http://a/b/c/g?y/../x       [R,X,5,6]
              http://a/b/c/x              [1,2,3,4]

<a href="g#s/./x">g#s/./x</a>    =  http://a/b/c/g#s/./x        [R,X,2,3,4,5,6]
              http://a/b/c/g#s/x          [1]

<p>Some parsers allow the scheme name to be present in a relative URI
reference if it is the same as the base URI scheme.  This is considered
to be a loophole in prior specifications of partial URI [RFC1630].
Its use should be avoided, but is allowed for backward compatibility.</p>
