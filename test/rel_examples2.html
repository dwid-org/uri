<H1>Examples of Resolving Relative URLs, Part 2</H1>

This document has an embedded base URL of
<PRE>
   Content-Base: http://a/b/c/d;p?q=1/2
</PRE>
the relative URLs should be resolved as shown below.  I am particularly
interested in testing whether "/" in query information is or is not
treated as part of the path hierarchy.
<P>
I will need your help testing the examples on multiple browsers. 
What you need to do is point to the example anchor and compare it to the
resolved URL in your browser (most browsers have a feature by which you
can see the resolved URL at the bottom of the window/screen when the anchor
is active).
<P>
Please send your test results to

<H3>Synopsis</H3>
 
RFC 1808 specified that the "/" character within query information
does not affect the hierarchy within URL parsing.  It would appear that
it does in current practice, but only within the relative path after
it is attached to the base path.  In other words, the base URLs query
information is being stripped off before any relative resolution.
