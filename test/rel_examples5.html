<H1>Examples of Resolving Relative URLs, Part 5</H1>

This document has an embedded base URL of
<PRE>
   Content-Base: http:///s//a/b/c
</PRE>
in order to test a notion that Tim Berners-Lee mentioned regarding
the ability of URIs to have a triple-slash (or even more slashes)
to indicate higher levels of hierarchy than those already used by URLs.
This is the same as Part 4, except that the scheme "fred" is replaced
with "http" for clients that stupidly change their parsing behavior
based on the scheme name.

<H3>Synopsis</H3>

RFC 1808 specified that the highest level for relative URLs is indicated
by a double-slash "//", and therefore that any triple-slash would be
considered a null site component, rather than a higher-level component
than the site component (as proposed by Tim).<P>

Draft 09 assumes that a triple-slash means an empty site component,
as does Netscape Navigator if the scheme is known.
Oddly, Lynx seems to straddle both sides.
