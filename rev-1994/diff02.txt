     those URLs which obtain global scope only when interpreted relative
     to a separate base URL.
  
!    A primary use for Uniform Resource Locators is to embed them within
     a document (referred to as the "base" document) for the purpose of
!    identifying other Internet-accessible resources.  This is
!    particularly true of hypertext documents, where URLs can serve as
!    the identifiers for hypertext link destinations. 
  
-    It is often the case that, where a group or "tree" of documents
-    serves a common purpose, the vast majority of URLs within those
-    documents point to locations within that tree rather than outside
-    of it.  Similarly, documents located at a particular Internet site
-    are much more likely to refer to other resources at that site than
-    to resources at remote sites.
- 
     Absolute URLs contain a great deal of information which may already
     be known from the context of the base document's retrieval, 
     including the access scheme, network location, and parts of the
     URL path.  In situations where the base URL is well-defined and
!    known to the parser (human or machine), it is useful to be able to
!    embed a URL reference which inherits that context rather than
!    re-specifying it within each instance.
  
!    In addition to the space saved, relative addressing of URLs allows
!    document trees to be partially independent of their location and/or
!    access scheme.  For instance, if they refer to each other using
!    relative URLs, it is possible for a single set of documents to be
!    simultaneously accessible and, if hypertext, traversable via each
!    of the "file", "http", and "ftp" access schemes. Furthermore,
!    document trees can be moved, as a whole, without changing any of
!    the embedded URLs.  Experience within the World-Wide Web has
!    demonstrated that the ability to perform relative referencing is
!    necessary for the long-term usability of embedded URLs.

  2.1.  URL Syntactic Components
  
-    The relative form relies on a property of the URL syntax that
-    certain characters ("/") and certain path segments ("..", ".") have
-    a significance reserved for representing a hierarchical space.
-    Additional reserved characters are sometimes used to separate the
-    URL path from other components, including object parameters (";"),
-    query information ("?"), and fragment identifiers ("#").
- 
     Like absolute URLs, relative URL syntax is dependent upon the access
     scheme.  Some schemes use "?" and ";" to indicate special reserved
     components, while others just consider them to be part of the path.
