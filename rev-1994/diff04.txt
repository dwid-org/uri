<    This work is derived from concepts introduced by the World-Wide Web
<    global information initiative, whose use of such objects dates from
<    1990 and is described in "Universal Resource Identifiers in WWW",
<    RFC 1630 [3].  This document is a companion to RFC 1738, 
<    "Uniform Resource Locators (URL)" [4], which specifies the
<    syntax and semantics of absolute URLs.  A URL is "absolute" if it
<    can be interpreted consistently and unambiguously, with global scope,
<    independent of any other URL.

<    The syntax for relative URLs is a subset of that for absolute
<    URLs [4].  Relative URLs are distinct in that some prefix of the URL
<    is missing and certain path components ("." and "..") have a special
<    meaning when interpreting a relative path.  Because a relative URL
<    may appear in any context that could hold an absolute URL, systems
<    that support relative URLs must be able to recognize them as part
<    of the URL parsing process.
