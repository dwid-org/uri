> 5.3.  Recommended Practice
> 
>    Although the relative form does allow scheme names to be used with
>    relative paths, as in the last two abnormal examples ("http:g" and
>    "http:") above, it is strongly recommended that authors not use the
>    scheme name in this manner.  Including the scheme name prevents a
>    relative URL from being usable in more than one context (e.g.,
>    simultaneous availability via "file" and "http") and requires that
>    the URL be changed if the primary access scheme is changed.
> 
>    Authors should also be aware that path names which contain a colon
>    ":" character cannot be used as the first component of a relative
>    URL path (e.g. "this:that") because they will likely be mistaken for
>    a scheme name.  It is therefore necessary to precede such cases with
>    other components (e.g., "./this:that"), or to escape the colon
>    character (e.g., "this%3Athat"), in order for them to be correctly
>    parsed.  The former solution is preferred because it has no effect
>    on the absolute form of the URL.
