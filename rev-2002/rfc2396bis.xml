<t>
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact string of characters
for identifying an abstract or physical resource.  This specification
defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references
that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security
considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.
</t>
<t>
The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs,
such that an implementation can parse the common components of a URI
reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative
grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual
specifications of each URI scheme.

<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
<t>
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) provides a simple and extensible
means for identifying a resource.  This specification of URI syntax
and semantics is derived from concepts introduced by the World Wide
Web global information initiative, whose use of such identifiers dates
from 1990 and is described in "Universal Resource Identifiers in WWW"
<xref target="RFC1630"/>, and is designed to meet the
recommendations laid out in "Functional Recommendations for Internet
Resource Locators" <xref target="RFC1736"/> and "Functional Requirements
for Uniform Resource Names" <xref target="RFC1737"/>.
</t>
<t>
This document obsoletes <xref target="RFC2396"/>, which merged
"Uniform Resource Locators" <xref target="RFC1738"/> and
"Relative Uniform Resource Locators" <xref target="RFC1808"/> in order
to define a single, generic syntax for all URIs.  It excludes those
portions of RFC 1738 that defined the specific syntax of individual
URI schemes; those portions will be updated as separate documents.
The process for registration of new URI schemes is defined separately
by <xref target="RFC2717"/>.
Advice for designers of new URI schemes can be found in
<xref target="RFC2718"/>.
</t>
<t>
All significant changes from RFC 2396 are noted in <xref target="changes"/>.
</t>
<t>
This specification uses the terms "character" and "character encoding"
in accordance with the definitions provided in <xref target="RFC2978"/>.
</t>

<section title="Overview of URIs" anchor="overview">
<t>
URIs are characterized as follows:
</t>
<iref item="uniform" primary="true"/>
<t>Uniform
  <list>
    <t>
Uniformity provides several benefits: it allows different types
of resource identifiers to be used in the same context, even
when the mechanisms used to access those resources may differ;
it allows uniform semantic interpretation of common syntactic
conventions across different types of resource identifiers; it
allows introduction of new types of resource identifiers
without interfering with the way that existing identifiers are
used; and, it allows the identifiers to be reused in many
different contexts, thus permitting new applications or
protocols to leverage a pre-existing, large, and widely-used
set of resource identifiers.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<iref item="resource" primary="true"/>
<t>Resource
  <list>
    <t>
Anything that can be named or described can be a resource.
Familiar examples include an electronic document, an image,
a service (e.g., "today's weather report for Los Angeles"),
and a collection of other resources.
A resource is not necessarily accessible via the Internet;
e.g., human beings, corporations, and bound books in a library
can also be resources.
Likewise, abstract concepts can be resources, such as the operators and
operands of a mathematical equation or the types of a relationship
(e.g., "parent" or "employee").
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<iref item="identifier" primary="true"/>
<t>Identifier
  <list>
    <t>
An identifier embodies the information required to distinguish what is
being identified from all other things within its scope of identification.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
A URI is an identifier that consists of a sequence of characters
matching the syntax defined by the syntax rule named "URI" in
<xref target="components"/>.
A URI can be used to refer to a resource.
This specification does not place any
limits on the nature of a resource or the reasons why an application
might wish to refer to a resource.  URIs have a global scope
and should be interpreted consistently regardless of context, but
that interpretation may be defined in relation to the user's context
(e.g., "http://localhost/" refers to a resource that is relative to
the user's network interface and yet not specific to any one user).
</t>

<section title="Generic Syntax" anchor="generic-syntax">
<iref item="generic syntax" primary="true"/>
<t>
Each URI begins with a scheme name, as defined in <xref target="scheme"/>,
that refers to a specification for assigning identifiers within that scheme.
As such, the URI syntax is a federated and extensible naming system wherein
each scheme's specification may further restrict the syntax and semantics
of identifiers using that scheme.
</t>
<t>
This specification defines those elements of the URI syntax that are
required of all URI schemes or are common to many URI schemes.  It thus
defines the syntax and semantics that are needed to implement a
scheme-independent parsing mechanism for URI references, such that the
scheme-dependent handling of a URI can be postponed until the
scheme-dependent semantics are needed.  Likewise, protocols and data
formats that make use of URI references can refer to this specification
as defining the range of syntax allowed for all URIs, including those
schemes that have yet to be defined.
</t>
<t>
A parser of the generic URI syntax is capable of parsing any URI
reference into its major components; once the scheme is determined,
further scheme-specific parsing can be performed on the components.
In other words, the URI generic syntax is a superset of the syntax
of all URI schemes.

<section title="URI, URL, and URN" anchor="URLvsURN">
<iref item="URL" primary="true"/>
<iref item="URN" primary="true"/>
<iref item="locator" primary="true"/>
<iref item="name" primary="true"/>
<t>
A URI can be further classified as a locator, a name, or both.  The
term "Uniform Resource Locator" (URL) refers to the subset of URIs
that, in addition to identifying a resource, provide a means of
locating the resource by describing its primary access mechanism
(e.g., its network "location").  The term "Uniform Resource Name" (URN)
has been used historically to refer to both URIs under the "urn" scheme
<xref target="RFC2141"/>, which are required to remain globally unique
and persistent even when the resource ceases to exist or becomes
unavailable, and to any other URI with the properties of a name.
</t>
<t>
An individual scheme does not need to be classified as being just one of
"name" or "locator".  Instances of URIs from any given scheme may have
the characteristics of names or locators or both, often depending on the
persistence and care in the assignment of identifiers by the naming
authority, rather than any quality of the scheme.  Future specifications
and related documentation should use the general term "URI", rather than
the more restrictive terms URL and URN <xref target="RFC3305"/>.
</t>
</section>

</section>
<section title="Design Considerations" anchor="design">
<section title="Transcription" anchor="transcription">
<iref item="transcription" primary="true"/>
<t>
The URI syntax has been designed with global transcription as one of
its main considerations.  A URI is a sequence of characters from a very
limited set: the letters of the basic Latin alphabet, digits,
and a few special characters.  A URI may be represented in a variety
of ways: e.g., ink on paper, pixels on a screen, or a sequence of
integers from a coded character set.  The interpretation of a URI depends
only on the characters used and not how those characters are
represented in a network protocol.
</t>
<t>
The goal of transcription can be described by a simple scenario.
Imagine two colleagues, Sam and Kim, sitting in a pub at an
international conference and exchanging research ideas.  Sam asks Kim
for a location to get more information, so Kim writes the URI for the
research site on a napkin.  Upon returning home, Sam takes out the
napkin and types the URI into a computer, which then retrieves the
information to which Kim referred.
</t>
<t>
There are several design considerations revealed by the scenario:
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>
A URI is a sequence of characters that is not always
represented as a sequence of octets.
    </t>
    <t>
A URI might be transcribed from a non-network source, and thus
should consist of characters that are most likely to be able to
be entered into a computer, within the constraints imposed by
keyboards (and related input devices) across languages and locales.
    </t>
    <t>
A URI often needs to be remembered by people, and it is easier
for people to remember a URI when it consists of meaningful or
familiar components.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
These design considerations are not always in alignment.  For example, it
is often the case that the most meaningful name for a URI component
would require characters that cannot be typed into some systems.  The
ability to transcribe a resource identifier from one medium to
another has been considered more important than having a URI consist of
the most meaningful of components.
</t>
<t>
In local or regional contexts and with improving technology, users might
benefit from being able to use a wider range of characters; such use
is not defined in this specification.  Percent-encoded octets
(<xref target="percent-encoding"/>) may be used within a URI to represent
characters outside the range of the US-ASCII coded character set if such
representation is defined by the scheme or by the protocol element
in which the URI is referenced; such a definition will specify the
character encoding scheme used to map those characters to octets prior
to being percent-encoded for the URI.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Separating Identification from Interaction"
         anchor="identification">
<iref item="access" primary="true"/>
<t>
A common misunderstanding of URIs is that they are only used to
refer to accessible resources.  In fact, the URI alone only provides
identification; access to the resource is neither guaranteed nor
implied by the presence of a URI.  Instead, an operation (if any)
associated with a URI reference is defined by the protocol element,
data format attribute, or natural language text in which it appears.
</t>
<iref item="resolution" primary="true"/>
<iref item="dereference" primary="true"/>
<t>
Given a URI, a system may attempt to perform a variety of operations
on the resource, as might be characterized by such words as
"access", "update", "replace", or "find attributes".  Such operations
are defined by the protocols that make use of URIs, not by this
specification.  However, we do use a few general terms for describing
common operations on URIs.  URI "resolution" is the process of determining
an access mechanism and the appropriate parameters necessary to dereference
a URI; such resolution may require several iterations.  To use that access
mechanism to perform an action on the URI's resource is to "dereference"
the URI.
</t>
<iref item="retrieval" primary="true"/>
<iref item="representation" primary="true"/>
<t>
When URIs are used within information systems to identify sources
of information, the most common form of URI dereference is "retrieval":
making use of a URI in order to retrieve a representation of its associated
resource.  A "representation" is a sequence of octets, along with
representation metadata describing those octets, that constitutes a
record of the state of the resource at the time that the representation
is generated.  Retrieval is achieved by a process that might include
using the URI as a cache key to check for a locally cached representation,
resolution of the URI to determine an appropriate access mechanism (if any),
and dereference of the URI for the sake of applying a retrieval operation.
Depending on the protocols used to perform the retrieval, additional
information might be supplied about the resource (resource metadata)
and its relation to other resources.
</t>
<iref item="sameness" primary="true"/>
<t>
URI references in information systems are designed to be late-binding:
the result of an access is generally determined at the time it is accessed
and may vary over time or due to other aspects of the interaction.
When an author creates a reference to such a resource, they do so with
the intention that the reference be used in the future; what is being
identified is not some specific result that was obtained in the past,
but rather some characteristic that is expected to be true for future
results.  In such cases, the resource referred to by the URI is actually
a sameness of characteristics as observed over time, perhaps elucidated
by additional comments or assertions made by the resource provider.
</t>
<t>
Although many URI schemes are named after protocols, this does not
imply that use of such a URI will result in access to the resource
via the named protocol.  URIs are often used simply for the sake of
identification.  Even when a URI is used to retrieve a representation
of a resource, that access might be through gateways, proxies, caches,
and name resolution services that are independent of the protocol
associated with the scheme name, and the resolution of some URIs may
require the use of more than one protocol (e.g., both DNS and HTTP
are typically used to access an "http" URI's origin server when
a representation isn't found in a local cache).
</t>
</section>

<section title="Hierarchical Identifiers" anchor="hierarchical">
<iref item="hierarchical" primary="true"/>
<t>
The URI syntax is organized hierarchically, with components listed
in order of decreasing significance from left to right.  For some URI schemes,
the visible hierarchy is limited to the scheme itself: everything after
the scheme component delimiter (":") is considered opaque to URI processing.
Other URI schemes make the hierarchy explicit and visible to
generic parsing algorithms.
</t>
<t>
The generic syntax uses the slash ("/"), question mark ("?"), and
number sign ("#") characters for the purpose of delimiting components
that are significant to the generic parser's hierarchical interpretation
of an identifier.  In addition to aiding the readability of such
identifiers through the consistent use of familiar syntax, this
uniform representation of hierarchy across naming schemes allows
scheme-independent references to be made relative to that hierarchy.
</t>
<iref item="relative" primary="true"/>
<t>
It is often the case that a group or "tree" of documents has been
constructed to serve a common purpose, wherein the vast majority of URIs
in these documents point to resources within the tree rather than
outside of it.  Similarly, documents located at a particular site are
much more likely to refer to other resources at that site than to
resources at remote sites.
Relative referencing of URIs allows document trees to be partially
independent of their location and access scheme.  For instance, it is
possible for a single set of hypertext documents to be simultaneously
accessible and traversable via each of the "file", "http", and "ftp"
schemes if the documents refer to each other using relative references.
Furthermore, such document trees can be moved, as a whole, without
changing any of the relative references.
</t>
<t>
A relative URI reference (<xref target="relative-uri"/>) refers to a
resource by describing the difference within a hierarchical name space
between the reference context and the target URI.  The reference resolution
algorithm, presented in <xref target="reference-resolution"/>, defines
how such a reference is transformed to the target URI.
Since relative references can only be used within the context of a
hierarchical URI, designers of new URI schemes should use a syntax
consistent with the generic syntax's hierarchical components unless there
are compelling reasons to forbid relative referencing within that scheme.
</t>
<t>
All URIs are parsed by generic syntax parsers when used. A URI scheme that
wishes to remain opaque to hierarchical processing must disallow the use
of slash and question mark characters.  However, since a non-relative URI
reference is only modified by the generic parser if it contains complete
path segments of "." or ".." (see <xref target="path"/>), URIs may safely
use "/" for other purposes if they do not allow dot-segments.

<t>
This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of
<xref target="RFC2234"/>, including the following core ABNF syntax rules
defined by that specification:
ALPHA (letters), CR (carriage return), CTL (control characters),
DIGIT (decimal digits), DQUOTE (double quote), HEXDIG (hexadecimal digits),
LF (line feed), and SP (space).
The complete URI syntax is collected in <xref target="collected-abnf"/>.
</t>
</section>

</section>

<section title="Characters" anchor="characters">
<iref item="characters" primary="true"/>
<t>
Although ABNF notation defines its terminal values to be non-negative
integers (codepoints) based on the US-ASCII coded character set
<xref target="ASCII"/>, we must invert that relation in order to understand
the URI syntax, since URIs are defined as strings of characters independent
of any particular encoding.  Therefore, the integer values must be mapped
back to their corresponding characters via US-ASCII in order to complete
the syntax rules.
</t>
<t>
This specification does not mandate the use of any particular
character encoding scheme for mapping between URI characters
and the octets used to store or transmit those characters.
When a URI appears in a protocol element, the character encoding is
defined by that protocol; absent such a definition, a URI is assumed
to use the same character encoding as the surrounding text.
</t>
<t>
A URI is composed from a limited set of characters consisting of
digits, letters, and a few graphic symbols.
A <xref target="reserved">reserved</xref> subset of those characters
may be used to delimit syntax components within a URI, while the remaining
characters, including both the <xref target="unreserved">unreserved</xref>
set and those reserved characters not acting as delimiters, define each
component's data.
</t>

<section title="Percent Encoding" anchor="percent-encoding">
<figure><preamble>
<iref item="percent-encoding" primary="true"/>
<iref item="pct-encoded" primary="true"/>
A percent-encoding mechanism is used to represent a data octet in a
component when that octet's corresponding character is outside
the allowed set or is being used as a delimiter of, or within, the component.
A percent-encoded octet is encoded as a character triplet, consisting of the
percent character "%" followed by the two hexadecimal digits representing
that octet's numeric value.  For example, "%20" is the percent-encoding
for the binary octet "00100000" (ABNF: %x20), which in US-ASCII corresponds
to the space character (SP).
<iref item="URI grammar" subitem="pct-encoded" primary="true"/>
</preamble><artwork type="abnf">
   pct-encoded = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG
</artwork><postamble>
The uppercase hexadecimal digits 'A' through 'F' are equivalent to the
lowercase digits 'a' through 'f', respectively.  Two URIs that differ
only in the case of hexadecimal digits used in percent-encoded octets are
equivalent.  For consistency, URI producers and normalizers should
use uppercase hexadecimal digits for all percent-encodings.
</postamble></figure>
</section>

<section title="Reserved Characters" anchor="reserved">
<figure><preamble>
<iref item="reserved" primary="true"/>
URIs include components and sub-components that are delimited by
characters in the "reserved" set.  These characters are called "reserved"
because they may (or may not) be defined as delimiters by the generic
syntax, by each scheme-specific syntax, or by the implementation-specific
syntax of a URI's dereferencing algorithm.  If data for a URI component
would conflict with a reserved character's purpose as a delimiter,
then the conflicting data must be percent-encoded before forming the URI.
<iref item="gen-delims" primary="true"/>
<iref item="sub-delims" primary="true"/>
<iref item="URI grammar" subitem="reserved" primary="true"/>
<iref item="URI grammar" subitem="gen-delims" primary="true"/>

</preamble><artwork type="abnf">
   reserved    = gen-delims / sub-delims

   gen-delims  = ":" / "/" / "?" / "#" / "[" / "]" / "@"

   sub-delims  = "!" / "$" / "&amp;" / "'" / "(" / ")"
               / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "="
</artwork></figure>
<t>
A subset of the reserved characters (gen-delims) are used as delimiters
of the generic URI components described in <xref target="components"/>.
A component's ABNF syntax rule will not use the reserved or gen-delims rule
names directly; instead, each syntax rule lists those reserved characters
that are allowed within that component (i.e., not delimiting it).  The allowed
reserved characters, including those in the sub-delims set and any of
the gen-delims that are not a delimiter of that component, are reserved
for use as sub-component delimiters within the component.  Only the most
common sub-components are defined by this specification; other
sub-components may be defined by a URI scheme's specification, or by the
implementation-specific syntax of a URI's dereferencing algorithm,
provided that such sub-components are delimited by characters in that
component's reserved set.  If no such delimiting role has been assigned,
then a reserved character appearing in a component represents the
data octet corresponding to its encoding in US-ASCII.
</t>
<t>
URIs that differ in the replacement of a reserved character with its
corresponding percent-encoded octet are not equivalent.  Percent-encoding
a reserved character, or decoding a percent-encoded octet that
corresponds to a reserved character, will change how the URI is
interpreted by most applications.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Unreserved Characters" anchor="unreserved">
<figure><preamble>
<iref item="unreserved" primary="true"/>
Characters that are allowed in a URI but do not have a reserved
purpose are called unreserved.  These include uppercase and lowercase
letters, decimal digits, hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde.
<iref item="URI grammar" subitem="unreserved" primary="true"/>
<iref item="URI grammar" subitem="mark" primary="true"/>
</preamble><artwork type="abnf">
   unreserved  = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"
</artwork></figure>
<t>
URIs that differ in the replacement of an unreserved character with
its corresponding percent-encoded octet are equivalent: they identify
the same resource.  However, percent-encoded unreserved characters may
change the result of some URI comparisons (<xref target="comparison"/>),
potentially leading to incorrect or inefficient behavior.
For consistency, percent-encoded octets in the ranges of
ALPHA (%41-%5A and %61-%7A), DIGIT (%30-%39), hyphen (%2D), period (%2E),
underscore (%5F), or tilde (%7E) should not be created by URI producers
and, when found in a URI, should be decoded to their corresponding
unreserved character by URI normalizers.
</t>
</section>

<section title="When to Encode or Decode" anchor="when-to-percent-encode">
<t>
Under normal circumstances, the only time that octets within a
URI are percent-encoded is during the process of producing
the URI from its component parts.  It is during that process that an
implementation determines which of the reserved characters are to be
used as sub-component delimiters and which can be safely used as data.
Once produced, a URI is always in its percent-encoded form.
</t>
<t>
When a URI is dereferenced, the components and sub-components significant
to the scheme-specific dereferencing process (if any) must be parsed and
separated before the percent-encoded octets within those components
can be safely decoded, since otherwise the data may be mistaken for
component delimiters.  The only exception is for percent-encoded octets
corresponding to characters in the unreserved set, which can be decoded
at any time.  For example, the octet corresponding to the tilde ("~")
character is often encoded as "%7E" by older URI processing software;
the "%7E" can be replaced by "~" without changing its interpretation.
</t>
<t>
Because the percent ("%") character serves as the indicator for
percent-encoded octets, it must be percent-encoded as "%25" in order
for that octet to be used as data within a URI.  Implementations must not
percent-encode or decode the same string more than once, since decoding
an already decoded string might lead to misinterpreting a percent data
octet as the beginning of a percent-encoding, or vice versa in the case
of percent-encoding an already percent-encoded string.
</t>
<t>
URI characters serve as an external interface for identification
between systems.  A system that internally provides identifiers in the
form of a different character encoding, such as EBCDIC, will generally
perform character translation of textual identifiers to UTF-8
<xref target="RFC3629"/> (or some other superset of the US-ASCII
character encoding) at an internal interface, since that results in more
meaningful identifiers than simply percent-encoding the original octets.
When interpreting an incoming URI on such an interface, percent-encoded
octets must be decoded before the reverse transcoding can be applied.
</t>
<t>
In some cases, the interface between a URI component and the identifying
data it has been crafted to represent is much less direct than a character
encoding translation.  For example, portions of a URI might reflect a
query on non-ASCII data, numeric coordinates on a map, etc.  Likewise,
a URI scheme may define components with additional encoding requirements,
such as base64, that are applied prior to forming the component and
producing the URI.
</t>
<t>
When a URI scheme defines a component that represents textual data
consisting of characters from the Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646-1) character
set, the data should be encoded first as octets according to the
UTF-8 character encoding <xref target="RFC3629"/>, and then only those
octets that do not correspond to characters in the unreserved set
should be percent-encoded.  For example, the character A would be
represented as "A", the character LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH GRAVE
would be represented as "%C3%80", and the character KATAKANA LETTER A
would be represented as "%E3%82%A2".

Each URI begins with a scheme name that refers to a specification for
assigning identifiers within that scheme. As such, the URI syntax is a
federated and extensible naming system wherein each scheme's specification
may further restrict the syntax and semantics of identifiers using that
scheme.
</t>
<figure><preamble>
Scheme names consist of a sequence of characters beginning with a
letter and followed by any combination of letters, digits, plus ("+"),
period ("."), or hyphen ("-").  Although scheme is case-insensitive,
the canonical form is lowercase and documents that specify schemes
must do so using lowercase letters.  An implementation should accept
uppercase letters as equivalent to lowercase in scheme names
(e.g., allow "HTTP" as well as "http"), for the sake of robustness,
but should only produce lowercase scheme names, for consistency.
<iref item="URI grammar" subitem="scheme" primary="true"/>
</preamble><artwork type="abnf">

Individual schemes are not specified by this document.
The process for registration of new URI schemes is defined separately

the mapping between scheme names and their specifications.
Advice for designers of new URI schemes can be found in
<xref target="RFC2718"/>.
</postamble></figure>
<t>
When presented with a URI that violates one or more scheme-specific
restrictions, the scheme-specific resolution process should flag
the reference as an error rather than ignore the unused parts; doing so
reduces the number of equivalent URIs and helps detect abuses of the
generic syntax that might indicate the URI has been constructed to
mislead the user (<xref target="security-semantic"/>).

<section title="Authority" anchor="authority">
<iref item="authority" primary="true"/>
<t>
Many URI schemes include a hierarchical element for a naming
authority, such that governance of the name space defined by the
remainder of the URI is delegated to that authority (which may,
in turn, delegate it further).  The generic syntax provides a common
means for distinguishing an authority based on a registered name
or server address, along with optional port and user information.
</t>

URI producers and normalizers should omit the "@" delimiter that
separates userinfo from host if the userinfo component is empty

from port if the port component is empty.
Some schemes do not allow the userinfo and/or port sub-components.
</postamble></figure>

<section title="User Information" anchor="userinfo">

<figure><preamble>
The userinfo sub-component may consist of a user name and, optionally,
scheme-specific information about how to gain authorization to access

commercial at-sign ("@") that delimits it from the host.

Use of the format "user:password" in the userinfo field is deprecated.
Applications should not render as clear text any data after the first
colon (":") character found within a userinfo sub-component unless
such data is the empty string (indicating no password) or "anonymous".
Applications may choose to ignore or reject such data when received
as part of a reference, and should reject the storage of such data
in unencrypted form.  The passing of authentication information in
clear text has proven to be a security risk in almost every case
where it has been used.
</t>
<t>
Applications that render a URI for the sake of user feedback, such
as in graphical hypertext browsing, should render userinfo in a way
that is distinguished from the rest of a URI, when feasible.  Such
rendering will assist the user in cases where the userinfo has been
misleadingly crafted to look like a trusted domain name

The syntax rule for host is ambiguous because it does not completely
distinguish between an IPv4address and a reg-name.  Again, the
"first-match-wins" algorithm applies: If host matches the rule for
IPv4address, then it should be considered an IPv4 address literal
and not a reg-name.  Although host is case-insensitive, producers
and normalizers should use lowercase for host names and hexadecimal
addresses for the sake of uniformity, while only using uppercase letters
for percent-encodings.

literal within square brackets ("[" and "]").  This is the only place

In anticipation of future, as-yet-undefined IP literal address formats,
an optional version flag may be used to indicate such a format
explicitly rather than relying on heuristic determination.

The version flag does not indicate the IP version; rather, it indicates
future versions of the literal format.  As such, implementations must
not provide the version flag for existing IPv4 and IPv6 literal addresses.
If a URI containing an IP-literal that starts with "v" (case-insensitive),
indicating that the version flag is present, is dereferenced by an application
that does not know the meaning of that version flag, then the application
should return an appropriate error for "address mechanism not supported".

A 128-bit IPv6 address is divided into eight 16-bit pieces.
Each piece is represented numerically in case-insensitive hexadecimal,
using one to four hexadecimal digits (leading zeroes are permitted).
The eight encoded pieces are given most-significant first, separated
by colon characters.  Optionally, the least-significant two pieces
may instead be represented in IPv4 address textual format.
A sequence of one or more consecutive zero-valued 16-bit pieces within

A host identified by a registered name is a string of
characters that is intended for lookup within a locally-defined host or
service name registry.  The most common of such registry mechanisms
is the Domain Name System (DNS), as defined by
Section 3 of <xref target="RFC1034"/> and
Section 2.1 of <xref target="RFC1123"/>.  A DNS name consists of a
sequence of domain labels separated by ".", each domain label starting and
ending with an alphanumeric character and possibly also containing "-"
characters.  The rightmost domain label of a fully qualified domain name
in DNS may be followed by a single "." and should be followed by one
if it is necessary to distinguish between the complete domain name and
some local domain.

If the host component is defined and the registered name is empty
(zero length), then the name defaults to "localhost"
(<xref target="normalize-scheme"/> discusses how this should be normalized).
If "localhost" is not determined by a host name lookup, then it should be
interpreted to mean the machine on which the URI is being resolved.
</postamble></figure>
<t>
This specification does not mandate a particular registered name lookup
technology and therefore does not restrict the syntax of reg-name beyond
that necessary for interoperability.  Instead, it delegates the issue of
host name syntax conformance to the operating system of each application
performing URI resolution, and that operating system decides what it will
allow for the purpose of host identification.
A URI resolution implementation might use DNS, host tables, yellow pages,
NetInfo, WINS, or any other system for lookup of host and service names.
However, a globally-scoped naming system, such as
DNS fully-qualified domain names, is necessary for URIs that are intended
to have global scope. URI producers should use host names that conform to
the DNS syntax, even when use of DNS is not immediately apparent.
</t>
<t>
The reg-name syntax allows percent-encoded octets in order to represent
non-ASCII host or service names in a uniform way that is independent of
the underlying name resolution technology; such octets must represent
characters encoded in the UTF-8 character encoding <xref target="RFC3629"/>
prior to being percent-encoded.
When a non-ASCII host name represents an internationalized domain name
intended for resolution via DNS, the name must be transformed to the
IDNA encoding <xref target="RFC3490"/> prior to name lookup.
URI producers should provide such host names in the IDNA encoding, rather
than a percent-encoding, if they wish to maximize interoperability with
legacy URI resolvers.
</t>
<t>
The presence of host within a URI does not imply that the scheme
requires access to the given host on the Internet.  In many cases,
the host syntax is used only for the sake of reusing the existing
registration process created and deployed for DNS, thus obtaining a
globally unique name without the cost of deploying another registry.
However, such use comes with its own costs: domain name ownership
may change over time for reasons not anticipated by the URI producer.

The path component contains data, usually organized in hierarchical form,
that, along with data in the non-hierarchical
<xref target="query">query component</xref>,
serves to identify a resource within the scope of the URI's
scheme and naming authority (if any).  If a URI contains an authority
component, then the initial path segment must be empty (i.e., the path must
begin with a slash ("/") character or be entirely empty).  The path is
terminated by the first question mark ("?") or number sign ("#") character,
or by the end of the URI.

</artwork></figure>
<t>
A path consists of a sequence of path segments separated by a
slash ("/") character.  A path is always defined for a URI, though
the defined path may be empty (zero length).  Use of the slash character
to indicate hierarchy is only required when a URI will be used as the
context for relative references.  For example, the URI
&lt;mailto:fred@example.com&gt; has a path of "fred@example.com", whereas
the URI &lt;foo://info.example.com?fred&gt; has an empty path.
</t>
<iref item="dot-segments" primary="true"/>
<t>
The path segments "." and ".." are defined for relative reference within
the path name hierarchy.  They are intended for use at the beginning of
a relative path reference (<xref target="relative-uri"/>) for indicating
relative position within the hierarchical tree of names.  This is similar
to their role within some operating systems' file directory structure to
indicate the current directory and parent directory, respectively.
However, unlike a file system, these dot-segments are only interpreted
within the URI path hierarchy and are removed as part of the
resolution process (<xref target="absolutize"/>).
</t>
<t>
Aside from dot-segments in hierarchical paths, a path segment is
considered opaque by the generic syntax.  URI-producing applications
often use the reserved characters allowed in a segment for the purpose
of delimiting scheme-specific or dereference-handler-specific sub-components.
For example, the semicolon (";") and equals ("=") reserved characters
are often used for delimiting parameters and parameter values
applicable to that segment.  The comma (",") reserved character is often
used for similar purposes.  For example, one URI producer might use
a segment like "name;v=1.1" to indicate a reference to version 1.1 of "name",
whereas another might use a segment like "name,1.1" to indicate the same.
Parameter types may be defined by scheme-specific semantics, but in most
cases the syntax of a parameter is specific to the implementation
of the URI's dereferencing algorithm.

<section title="Query" anchor="query">

The query component contains non-hierarchical data that, along with data

resource within the scope of the URI's scheme and naming authority (if any).
The query component is indicated by the first question mark ("?") character

The characters slash ("/") and question mark ("?") may represent data
within the query component, but should not be used as such within a URI
that is expected to be the base for relative references
(<xref target="base-uri"/>).  Incorrect implementations of reference
resolution often fail to distinguish query data from path data when looking
for hierarchical separators, thus resulting in non-interoperable results.
However, since query components are often used to carry identifying information
in the form of "key=value" pairs, and one frequently used value is a
reference to another URI, it is sometimes better for usability to
avoid percent-encoding those characters.

<section title="Fragment" anchor="fragment">
<figure><preamble>
<iref item="fragment" primary="true"/>
The fragment identifier component of a URI allows indirect identification
of a secondary resource by reference to a primary resource and additional
identifying information.  The identified secondary resource may be some
portion or subset of the primary resource, some view on representations
of the primary resource, or some other resource defined or described by
those representations.  A fragment identifier component is indicated by
the presence of a number sign ("#") character and terminated by the end
of the URI.
<iref item="URI grammar" subitem="fragment" primary="true"/>
<iref item="URI grammar" subitem="pchar" primary="false"/>
</preamble><artwork type="abnf">
   fragment    = *( pchar / "/" / "?" )
</artwork></figure>
<t>
The semantics of a fragment identifier are defined by the set of
representations that might result from a retrieval action on the primary
resource. The fragment's format and resolution is therefore dependent on
the media type <xref target="RFC2046"/> of a potentially retrieved
representation, even though such a retrieval is only performed if the URI
is dereferenced.
Individual media types may define their own restrictions on, or structure
within, the fragment identifier syntax for specifying different types of
subsets, views, or external references that are identifiable as secondary
resources by that media type.  If the primary resource has multiple
representations, as is often the case for resources whose representation
is selected based on attributes of the retrieval request (a.k.a., content
negotiation), then whatever is identified by the fragment should be
consistent across all of those representations: each representation should
either define the fragment such that it corresponds to the same secondary
resource, regardless of how it is represented, or the fragment should be
left undefined by the representation (i.e., not found).
</t>
<t>
As with any URI, use of a fragment identifier component does not imply
that a retrieval action will take place.  A URI with a fragment identifier
may be used to refer to the secondary resource without any implication
that the primary resource is accessible or will ever be accessed.
</t>
<t>
Fragment identifiers have a special role in information systems as
the primary form of client-side indirect referencing, allowing
an author to specifically identify those aspects of an existing
resource that are only indirectly provided by the resource owner.
As such, interpretation of the fragment identifier during a retrieval
action is performed solely by the user agent; the fragment identifier
is not passed to other systems during the process of retrieval.
Although this is often perceived to be a loss of information,
particularly in regards to accurate redirection of references as
content moves over time, it also serves to prevent information
providers from denying reference authors the right to selectively
refer to information within a resource.
</t>
<t>
The characters slash ("/") and question mark ("?") are allowed to
represent data within the fragment identifier, but should not be used
as such within a URI that is expected to be the base for relative references
(<xref target="base-uri"/>) for the same reasons as described above for query.

When applications make reference to a URI, they do not always use the

In order to save space and take advantage of hierarchical locality,
many Internet protocol elements and media type formats allow an
abbreviation of a URI, while others restrict the syntax to a particular
form of URI.  We define the most common forms of reference syntax in
this specification because they impact and depend upon the design of

A relative reference that begins with a single slash character is
termed an absolute-path reference.  A relative reference that does not
begin with a slash character is termed a relative-path reference.
</t>
<t>
A path segment that contains a colon character (e.g., "this:that")
cannot be used as the first segment of a relative-path reference
because it would be mistaken for a scheme name.  Such a segment must be
preceded by a dot-segment (e.g., "./this:that") to make a relative-path
reference.

Some protocol elements allow only the absolute form of a URI without
a fragment identifier.  For example, defining a base URI for later
use by relative references calls for an absolute-URI syntax rule that

<section title="Same-document Reference" anchor="same-document">
<iref item="same-document" primary="true"/>
<t>
When a URI reference refers to a URI that is, aside from its fragment
component (if any), identical to the base URI (<xref target="base-uri"/>),
that reference is called a "same-document" reference.  The most frequent
examples of same-document references are relative references that are empty
or include only the number sign ("#") separator followed by a fragment
identifier.
</t>
<t>
When a same-document reference is dereferenced for the purpose of a
retrieval action, the target of that reference is defined to be within
the same entity (representation, document, or message) as the reference;
therefore, a dereference should not result in a new retrieval action.
</t>
<t>
Normalization of the base and target URIs prior to their comparison,
as described in <xref target="normalize-syntax"/> and
<xref target="normalize-scheme"/>, is allowed but rarely performed
in practice.  Normalization may increase the set of same-document
references, which may be of benefit to some caching applications.
As such, reference authors should not assume that a slightly different,
though equivalent, reference URI will (or will not) be interpreted as a
same-document reference by any given application.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Suffix Reference" anchor="suffix">
<iref item="suffix" primary="true"/>
<t>
The URI syntax is designed for unambiguous reference to resources and
extensibility via the URI scheme.  However, as URI identification and
usage have become commonplace, traditional media (television, radio,
newspapers, billboards, etc.) have increasingly used a suffix of
the URI as a reference, consisting of only the authority and path
portions of the URI, such as
</t>
<figure><artwork>
   www.w3.org/Addressing/
</artwork></figure>
<t>
or simply a DNS registered name on its own.  Such references are primarily
intended for human interpretation, rather than for machines, with the
assumption that context-based heuristics are sufficient to complete
the URI (e.g., most host names beginning with "www" are likely to have
a URI prefix of "http://").  Although there is no standard set of
heuristics for disambiguating a URI suffix, many client implementations
allow them to be entered by the user and heuristically resolved.
</t>
<t>
While this practice of using suffix references is common, it should
be avoided whenever possible and never used in situations where long-term
references are expected.  The heuristics noted above will change over time,
particularly when a new URI scheme becomes popular, and are often
incorrect when used out of context.  Furthermore, they can lead to
security issues along the lines of those described in
<xref target="RFC1535"/>.
</t>
<t>
Since a URI suffix has the same syntax as a relative path reference, a
suffix reference cannot be used in contexts where a relative reference
is expected.  As a result, suffix references are limited to those places where
there is no defined base URI, such as dialog boxes and off-line advertisements.

<section title="Establishing a Base URI" anchor="base-uri">
<iref item="base URI" primary="true"/>
<t>
The term "relative" implies that there exists a "base URI" against
which the relative reference is applied.  Aside from fragment-only
references (<xref target="same-document"/>), relative references are
only usable when a base URI is known.  A base URI must be established
by the parser prior to parsing URI references that might be relative.
</t>
<t>
The base URI of a reference can be established in one of four ways,
discussed below in order of precedence.  The order of precedence can be
thought of in terms of layers, where the innermost defined base URI
has the highest precedence.  This can be visualized graphically as:

<section title="Base URI within Document Content" anchor="base-context">
<t>
Within certain media types, a base URI for relative references can
be embedded within the content itself such that it can be readily
obtained by a parser.  This can be useful for descriptive documents,
such as tables of content, which may be transmitted to others through
protocols other than their usual retrieval context (e.g., E-Mail or
USENET news).
</t>
<t>
It is beyond the scope of this specification to specify how, for each
media type, a base URI can be embedded.  The appropriate syntax, when
available, is described by each media type's specification.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Base URI from the Encapsulating Entity"
         anchor="base-encapsulated">
<t>
If no base URI is embedded, the base URI is defined by the representation's
retrieval context.  For a document that is enclosed within another entity,
such as a message or archive, the retrieval context is that entity; thus,
the default base URI of a representation is the base URI of the entity in
which the representation is encapsulated.
</t>
<t>
A mechanism for embedding a base URI within MIME container types
(e.g., the message and multipart types) is defined by MHTML
<xref target="RFC2110"/>.  Protocols that do not use the MIME message
header syntax, but do allow some form of tagged metadata to be included
within messages, may define their own syntax for defining a base
URI as part of a message.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Base URI from the Retrieval URI" anchor="base-retrieval">
<t>
If no base URI is embedded and the representation is not encapsulated
within some other entity, then, if a URI was used to retrieve the
representation, that URI shall be considered the base URI.
Note that if the retrieval was the
result of a redirected request, the last URI used (i.e., the URI that
resulted in the actual retrieval of the representation) is the base URI.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Default Base URI" anchor="base-default">
<t>
If none of the conditions described above apply,
then the base URI is defined by the context of the application.
Since this definition is necessarily application-dependent, failing
to define a base URI using one of the other methods may result in
the same content being interpreted differently by different types of
application.
</t>
<t>
A sender of a representation containing relative references is responsible
for ensuring that a base URI for those references can be established.
Aside from fragment-only references, relative references can only be used
reliably in situations where the base URI is well-defined.

This section describes an algorithm for converting a URI reference

as described in <xref target="recomposition"/>, to form the target URI.
This algorithm provides definitive results that can be used to test
the output of other implementations.  Applications may implement
relative reference resolution using some other algorithm, provided that
the results match what would be given by this algorithm.

may be empty or undefined.  A component is undefined if its associated
delimiter does not appear in the URI reference; the path component is
never undefined, though it may be empty.

Normalization of the base URI, as described in

The pseudocode above refers to a "merge" routine for merging a

accomplished as follows:

for interpreting and removing the special "." and ".." complete
path segments from a referenced path.  This is done after the
path is extracted from a reference, whether or not the path
was relative, in order to remove any invalid or extraneous
dot-segments prior to forming the target URI.  Although there
are many ways to accomplish this removal process, we describe a
simple method using a two string buffers.
<list style="numbers">

The input buffer is initialized with the now-appended path components

<t>
While the input buffer is not empty, loop:
<list style="numbers">

a complete path segment, then replace that prefix with "/"; otherwise

a complete path segment, then replace that prefix with "/" and
remove the last segment and its preceding "/" (if any) from the

Remove the first segment and its preceding "/" (if any) from the

<section title="Abnormal Examples" anchor="relative-abnormal">
<t>
Although the following abnormal examples are unlikely to occur in
normal practice, all URI parsers should be capable of resolving them
consistently.  Each example uses the same base as above.
</t>
<t>
Parsers must be careful in handling cases where there are more
relative path ".." segments than there are hierarchical levels in the
base URI's path.  Note that the ".." syntax cannot be used to change
the authority component of a URI.
</t>
<figure><artwork>
   "../../../g"    =  "http://a/g"
   "../../../../g" =  "http://a/g"

Similarly, parsers must remove the dot-segments "." and ".." when
they are complete components of a path, but not when they are only
part of a segment.
</t>
<figure><artwork>
   "/./g"          =  "http://a/g"
   "/../g"         =  "http://a/g"

   ".g"            =  "http://a/b/c/.g"
   "g.."           =  "http://a/b/c/g.."
   "..g"           =  "http://a/b/c/..g"
</artwork></figure>
<t>
Less likely are cases where the relative URI reference uses unnecessary or
nonsensical forms of the "." and ".." complete path segments.
</t>
<figure><artwork>
   "./../g"        =  "http://a/b/g"
   "./g/."         =  "http://a/b/c/g/"

   "g;x=1/../y"    =  "http://a/b/c/y"
</artwork></figure>
<t>
Some applications fail to separate the reference's query and/or
fragment components from a relative path before merging it with
the base path and removing dot-segments.  This error is rarely noticed,
since typical usage of a fragment never includes the hierarchy ("/")
character, and the query component is not normally used within
relative references.
</t>
<figure><artwork>
   "g?y/./x"       =  "http://a/b/c/g?y/./x"

   "g#s/../x"      =  "http://a/b/c/g#s/../x"

Some parsers allow the scheme name to be present in a relative URI reference if
it is the same as the base URI scheme.  This is considered to be a
loophole in prior specifications of partial URI <xref target="RFC1630"/>.
Its use should be avoided, but is allowed for backward compatibility.

<section title="Normalization and Comparison" anchor="comparison">
<t>
One of the most common operations on URIs is simple comparison:
determining if two URIs are equivalent without using the URIs to
access their respective resource(s).  A comparison is performed
every time a response cache is accessed, a browser checks its
history to color a link, or an XML parser processes tags within a namespace.
Extensive normalization prior to comparison of URIs is often used
by spiders and indexing engines to prune a search space or
reduce duplication of request actions and response storage.
</t>
<t>
URI comparison is performed in respect to some particular purpose,
and software with differing purposes will often be subject to differing
design trade-offs in regards to how much effort should be spent in
reducing duplicate identifiers.  This section describes a variety of
methods that may be used to compare URIs, the trade-offs between them,
and the types of applications that might use them.
</t>

<section title="Equivalence" anchor="equivalence">
<t>
Since URIs exist to identify resources, presumably they should be
considered equivalent when they identify the same resource.  However,
such a definition of equivalence is not of much practical use, since
there is no way for software to compare two resources without knowledge
of the implementation-specific syntax of each URI's dereferencing algorithm.
For this reason, determination of equivalence or
difference of URIs is based on string comparison, perhaps augmented by
reference to additional rules provided by URI scheme definitions.
We use the terms "different" and "equivalent" to describe
the possible outcomes of such comparisons, but there
are many application-dependent versions of equivalence.
</t>
<t>
Even though it is possible to determine that two URIs are equivalent,
it is never possible to be sure that two URIs identify different
resources. For example, an owner of two different domain names could
decide to serve the same resource from both, resulting in two different
URIs.  Therefore, comparison methods are designed to minimize
false negatives while strictly avoiding false positives.
</t>
<t>
In testing for equivalence, applications should not directly compare
relative URI references; the references should be converted to their
target URI forms before comparison.  When URIs are being compared
for the purpose of selecting (or avoiding) a network action, such as
retrieval of a representation, the fragment components (if any) should
be excluded from the comparison.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Comparison Ladder" anchor="comparison-ladder">
<t>
A variety of methods are used in practice to test URI equivalence.
These methods fall into a range, distinguished by the amount of
processing required and the degree to which the probability of false
negatives is reduced.  As noted above, false negatives cannot in
principle be eliminated.  In practice, their probability can be reduced,
but this reduction requires more processing and is not cost-effective
for all applications.
</t>
<t>
If this range of comparison practices is considered as a ladder, the
following discussion will climb the ladder, starting with those practices that
are cheap but have a relatively higher chance of producing false negatives,
and proceeding to those that have higher computational cost and lower risk
of false negatives.
</t>

<section title="Simple String Comparison" anchor="comparison-string">
<t>
If two URIs, considered as character strings, are identical, then it is
safe to conclude that they are equivalent.  This type of equivalence test
has very low computational cost and is in wide use in a variety of
applications, particularly in the domain of parsing.
</t>
<t>
Testing strings for equivalence requires some basic precautions.
This procedure is often referred to as "bit-for-bit" or "byte-for-byte"
comparison, which is potentially misleading.  Testing of strings for
equality is normally based on pairwise comparison of the characters
that make up the strings, starting from the first and proceeding until
both strings are exhausted and all characters found to be equal, a
pair of characters compares unequal, or one of the strings is exhausted
before the other.
</t>
<t>
Such character comparisons require that each pair of characters be put
in comparable form.  For example, should one URI be stored in a byte
array in EBCDIC encoding, and the second be in a Java String object (UTF-16),
bit-for-bit comparisons applied naively will produce both false-positive
and false-negative errors.  It is better to speak of equality on a
character-for-character rather than byte-for-byte or bit-for-bit basis.
In practical terms, character-by-character comparisons should be done
codepoint-by-codepoint after conversion to a common character encoding.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Syntax-based Normalization" anchor="normalize-syntax">
<figure><preamble>
Software may use logic based on the definitions provided by this
specification to reduce the probability of false negatives.  Such
processing is moderately higher in cost than character-for-character
string comparison.  For example, an application using this approach
could reasonably consider the following two URIs equivalent:
</preamble><artwork>
   example://a/b/c/%7Bfoo%7D
   eXAMPLE://a/./b/../b/%63/%7bfoo%7d
</artwork><postamble>
Web user agents, such as browsers, typically apply this type of URI
normalization when determining whether a cached response is available.
Syntax-based normalization includes such techniques as case normalization,
encoding normalization, empty-component normalization, and removal of
dot-segments.
</postamble></figure>

<section title="Case Normalization" anchor="normalize-case">
<t>
When a URI scheme uses components of the generic syntax, it will
also use the common syntax equivalence rules, namely that the scheme
and host are case-insensitive and therefore should be normalized
to lowercase.  For example, the URI &lt;HTTP://www.EXAMPLE.com/&gt; is
equivalent to &lt;http://www.example.com/&gt;.  Applications should not
assume anything about the case sensitivity of other URI components,
since that is dependent on the implementation used to handle a dereference.
</t>
<t>
The hexadecimal digits within a percent-encoding triplet (e.g., "%3a"
versus "%3A") are case-insensitive and therefore should be normalized
to use uppercase letters for the digits A-F.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Encoding Normalization" anchor="normalize-encoding">
<t>
The percent-encoding mechanism (<xref target="percent-encoding"/>)
is a frequent source of variance among otherwise identical URIs.
In addition to the case-insensitivity issue noted above, some URI
producers percent-encode octets that do not require percent-encoding,
resulting in URIs that are equivalent to their non-encoded counterparts.
Such URIs should be normalized by decoding any percent-encoded octet
that corresponds to an unreserved character, as described in
<xref target="unreserved"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Empty-component Normalization" anchor="normalize-empty">
<figure><preamble>
Components of the generic URI syntax are delimited from other components
by optional separators.  For example, a query component is separated
from the path by a question mark ("?") and a port sub-component is
separated from host by a colon (":").  A URI in which a delimiter is
present and the (sub-)component it delimits is empty is equivalent to
the same URI without that delimiter.  For example, the following are
all equivalent:
</preamble><artwork>
   ftp://example.com/
   ftp://example.com:/
   ftp://@example.com:/
   ftp://@example.com:/?
   ftp://@example.com:/?#
</artwork><postamble>
URI producers and normalizers should omit a delimiter if the component
it delimits is empty, as exemplified by the first URI above, with one
exception: a double-slash delimiter indicating an authority component should
not be removed, even when the authority is empty, since doing so can lead
to misinterpreting the path.
</postamble></figure>
</section>

<section title="Path Segment Normalization" anchor="normalize-path">
<t>
The complete path segments "." and ".." have a special meaning within
hierarchical URI schemes.  As such, they should not appear in absolute
paths; if they are found, they can be removed by applying the
remove_dot_segments algorithm to the path, as described in
<xref target="absolutize"/>.
</t>
</section>

</section>

<section title="Scheme-based Normalization" anchor="normalize-scheme">
<figure><preamble>
The syntax and semantics of URIs vary from scheme to scheme, as described
by the defining specification for each scheme.  Software may use
scheme-specific rules, at further processing cost, to reduce the
probability of false negatives.  For example, since the "http" scheme
makes use of an authority component, has a default port of "80", and
defines an empty path to be equivalent to "/", the following four URIs
are equivalent:
</preamble><artwork>
   http://example.com
   http://example.com/
   http://example.com:/
   http://example.com:80/
</artwork><postamble>
In general, a URI that uses the generic syntax for authority with an
empty path should be normalized to a path of "/"; likewise, an explicit
":port", where the port is empty or the default for the scheme, is
equivalent to one where the port and its ":" delimiter are elided.
In other words, the second of the above URI examples is the normal form
for the "http" scheme.
</postamble></figure>
<t>
Another case where normalization varies by scheme is in the handling
of an empty authority component.  For many scheme specifications, an
empty authority is considered an error; for others, it is considered
equivalent to "localhost".  For the sake of uniformity, future scheme
specifications should define an empty authority as being equivalent
to "localhost", and URI producers and normalizers should use
"localhost" instead of an empty authority.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Protocol-based Normalization" anchor="normalize-protocol">
<figure><preamble>
Web spiders, for which substantial effort to reduce the incidence
of false negatives is often cost-effective, are observed to implement
even more aggressive techniques in URI comparison.  For example, if they
observe that a URI such as
</preamble><artwork>
   http://example.com/data
</artwork></figure>
<figure><preamble>
redirects to a URI differing only in the trailing slash
</preamble><artwork>
   http://example.com/data/
</artwork><postamble>
they will likely regard the two as equivalent in the future.
This kind of technique is only appropriate when equivalence is clearly
indicated by both the result of accessing the resources and the common
conventions of their scheme's dereference algorithm (in this case,
use of redirection by HTTP origin servers to avoid problems with
relative references).
</postamble></figure>
</section>

</section>

<section title="Canonical Form" anchor="canonical-form">
<t>
It is in the best interests of everyone to avoid false-negatives in
comparing URIs and to minimize the amount of software processing for
such comparisons.  Those who produce and make reference to URIs can
reduce the cost of processing and the risk of false negatives by
consistently providing them in a form that is reasonably canonical
with respect to their scheme.  Specifically:
<list style="symbols">
  <t>Always provide the URI scheme in lowercase characters.</t>
  <t>Always provide the host, if any, in lowercase characters.</t>
  <t>Only perform percent-encoding where it is essential.</t>
  <t>Always use uppercase A-through-F characters when percent-encoding.</t>
  <t>Prevent /./ and /../ from appearing in non-relative URI paths.</t>
  <t>Omit delimiters when their associated (sub-)component is empty.</t>
  <t>For schemes that define an empty authority to be equivalent to
     "localhost", use "localhost".</t>
  <t>For schemes that define an empty path to be equivalent to a path
     of "/", use "/".</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

</section>

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
<t>
A URI does not in itself pose a security threat.  However, since URIs
are often used to provide a compact set of instructions for access to
network resources, care must be taken to properly interpret the data
within a URI, to prevent that data from causing unintended access, and
to avoid including data that should not be revealed in plain text.
</t>
<section title="Reliability and Consistency" anchor="security-reliability">
<t>
There is no guarantee that, having once used a given URI to retrieve
some information, the same information will be retrievable by
that URI in the future. Nor is there any guarantee that the information
retrievable via that URI in the future will be observably similar to
that retrieved in the past.  The URI syntax does not constrain how a
given scheme or authority apportions its name space or maintains it
over time.  Such a guarantee can only be obtained from the person(s)
controlling that name space and the resource in question.  A specific
URI scheme may define additional semantics, such as name persistence,
if those semantics are required of all naming authorities for that scheme.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Malicious Construction" anchor="security-malicious">
<t>
It is sometimes possible to construct a URI such that an attempt to
perform a seemingly harmless, idempotent operation, such as the
retrieval of a representation, will in fact cause a possibly damaging
remote operation to occur.  The unsafe URI is typically constructed by
specifying a port number other than that reserved for the network protocol
in question.  The client unwittingly contacts a site that is running a
different protocol service and data within the URI contains instructions
that, when interpreted according to this other protocol, cause an
unexpected operation.  A frequent example of such abuse has been the use
of a protocol-based scheme with a port component of "25", thereby fooling
user agent software into sending an unintended or impersonating message
via an SMTP server.
</t>
<t>
Applications should prevent dereference of a URI that specifies a
TCP port number within the "well-known port" range (0 - 1023) unless
the protocol being used to dereference that URI is compatible with the
protocol expected on that well-known port. Although IANA maintains a
registry of well-known ports, applications should make such restrictions
user-configurable to avoid preventing the deployment of new services.
</t>
<t>
When a URI contains percent-encoded octets that match the delimiters for
a given resolution or dereference protocol (for example, CR and LF characters
for the TELNET protocol), such percent-encoded octets must not be decoded
before transmission across that protocol.  Transfer of the percent-encoding,
which might violate the protocol, is less harmful than allowing decoded
octets to be interpreted as additional operations or parameters, perhaps
triggering an unexpected and possibly harmful remote operation.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Back-end Transcoding" anchor="security-transcoding">
<t>
When a URI is dereferenced, the data within it is often parsed by both
the user agent and one or more servers.  In HTTP, for example, a typical
user agent will parse a URI into its five major components, access the
authority's server, and send it the data within the authority, path, and
query components.  A typical server will take that information, parse
the path into segments and the query into key/value pairs, and then
invoke implementation-specific handlers to respond to the request.
As a result, a common security concern for server implementations that
handle a URI, either as a whole or split into separate components,
is proper interpretation of the octet data represented by the characters
and percent-encodings within that URI.
</t>
<t>
Percent-encoded octets must be decoded at some point during the
dereference process.  Applications must split the URI into its
components and sub-components prior to decoding the octets, since
otherwise the decoded octets might be mistaken for delimiters.  Security
checks of the data within a URI should be applied after decoding the
octets.  Note, however, that the "%00" percent-encoding (NUL) may require
special handling and should be rejected if the application is not expecting
to receive raw data within a component.
</t>
<t>
Special care should be taken when the URI path interpretation process
involves the use of a back-end filesystem or related system functions.
Filesystems typically assign an operational meaning to special characters,
such as the "/", "\", ":", "[", and "]" characters, and
special device names like ".", "..", "...", "aux", "lpt", etc.
In some cases, merely testing for the existence of such a name will
cause the operating system to pause or invoke unrelated system calls,
leading to significant security concerns regarding denial of service
and unintended data transfer.  It would be impossible for this specification
to list all such significant characters and device names; implementers
should research the reserved names and characters for the types of
storage device that may be attached to their application and restrict
the use of data obtained from URI components accordingly.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Rare IP Address Formats" anchor="security-ipv4">
<t>
Although the URI syntax for IPv4address only allows the common,
dotted-decimal form of IPv4 address literal, many implementations that
process URIs make use of platform-dependent system routines, such as
gethostbyname() and inet_aton(), to translate the string literal to an
actual IP address.  Unfortunately, such system routines often allow and
process a much larger set of formats than those described in
<xref target="host"/>.
</t>
<t>
For example, many implementations allow dotted forms of three numbers,
wherein the last part is interpreted as a 16-bit quantity and placed in
the right-most two bytes of the network address (e.g., a Class B network).
Likewise, a dotted form of two numbers means the last part is interpreted
as a 24-bit quantity and placed in the right most three bytes of the network
address (Class A), and a single number (without dots) is interpreted as
a 32-bit quantity and stored directly in the network address.  Adding
further to the confusion, some implementations allow each dotted part
to be interpreted as decimal, octal, or hexadecimal, as specified in
the C language (i.e., a leading 0x or 0X implies hexadecimal; otherwise,
a leading 0 implies octal; otherwise, the number is interpreted as decimal).
</t>
<t>
These additional IP address formats are not allowed in the URI syntax
due to differences between platform implementations.  However, they
can become a security concern if an application attempts to filter
access to resources based on the IP address in string literal format.
If such filtering is performed, literals should be converted to numeric
form and filtered based on the numeric value, rather than a prefix or
suffix of the string form.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Sensitive Information" anchor="security-sensitive">
<t>
URI producers should not provide a URI that contains a username or
password which is intended to be secret: URIs are frequently
displayed by browsers, stored in clear text bookmarks, and logged
by user agent history and intermediary applications (proxies).
A password appearing within the userinfo component is deprecated and
should be considered an error (or simply ignored) except in those
rare cases where the 'password' parameter is intended to be public.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Semantic Attacks" anchor="security-semantic">
<figure><preamble>
Because the userinfo sub-component is rarely used and appears before the
host in the authority component, it can be used to construct a URI
that is intended to mislead a human user by appearing to identify one
(trusted) naming authority while actually identifying a different
authority hidden behind the noise.  For example
</preamble><artwork>
   ftp://ftp.example.com&amp;story=breaking_news@10.0.0.1/top_story.htm
</artwork><postamble>
might lead a human user to assume that the host is 'trusted.example.com',
whereas it is actually '10.0.0.1'.  Note that a misleading userinfo
sub-component could be much longer than the example above.
</postamble></figure>
<t>
A misleading URI, such as the one above, is an attack on the user's
preconceived notions about the meaning of a URI, rather than an attack
on the software itself.  User agents may be able to reduce the impact
of such attacks by distinguishing the various components of
the URI when rendered, such as by using a different color or tone to
render userinfo if any is present, though there is no general panacea.
More information on URI-based semantic attacks can be found in
<xref target="Siedzik"/>.

<section title="Parsing a URI Reference with a Regular Expression" anchor="regexp">
<t>
Since the "first-match-wins" algorithm is identical to the "greedy"
disambiguation method used by POSIX regular expressions, it is
natural and commonplace to use a regular expression for parsing the
potential five components of a URI reference.
</t>
<t>
The following line is the regular expression for breaking-down a
well-formed URI reference into its components.
</t>
<figure><artwork>
   ^(([^:/?#]+):)?(//([^/?#]*))?([^?#]*)(\?([^#]*))?(#(.*))?
    12            3  4          5       6  7        8 9
</artwork></figure>
<t>
The numbers in the second line above are only to assist readability;
they indicate the reference points for each subexpression (i.e., each
paired parenthesis).  We refer to the value matched for subexpression
&lt;n&gt; as $&lt;n&gt;.  For example, matching the above expression to
</t>
<figure><artwork>
   http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/#Related
</artwork></figure>
<t>
results in the following subexpression matches:
</t>
<figure><artwork>
   $1 = http:
   $2 = http
   $3 = //www.ics.uci.edu
   $4 = www.ics.uci.edu
   $5 = /pub/ietf/uri/
   $6 = &lt;undefined&gt;
   $7 = &lt;undefined&gt;
   $8 = #Related
   $9 = Related
</artwork></figure>
<t>
where &lt;undefined&gt; indicates that the component is not present, as is
the case for the query component in the above example.  Therefore, we
can determine the value of the four components and fragment as
</t>
<figure><artwork>
   scheme    = $2
   authority = $4
   path      = $5
   query     = $7
   fragment  = $9
</artwork></figure>
<t>
and, going in the opposite direction, we can recreate a URI reference
from its components using the algorithm of <xref target="recomposition"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Delimiting a URI in Context" anchor="delimiting">
<t>
URIs are often transmitted through formats that do not provide a clear
context for their interpretation.  For example, there are many
occasions when a URI is included in plain text; examples include text
sent in electronic mail, USENET news messages, and, most importantly,
printed on paper.  In such cases, it is important to be able to
delimit the URI from the rest of the text, and in particular from
punctuation marks that might be mistaken for part of the URI.
</t>
<t>
In practice, URIs are delimited in a variety of ways, but usually
within double-quotes "http://example.com/", angle brackets
&lt;http://example.com/&gt;, or just using whitespace
</t>
<figure><artwork>
   http://example.com/
</artwork></figure>
<t>
These wrappers do not form part of the URI.
</t>
<t>
In some cases, extra whitespace (spaces, line-breaks, tabs, etc.) may
need to be added to break a long URI across lines. The whitespace
should be ignored when extracting the URI.
</t>
<t>
No whitespace should be introduced after a hyphen ("-") character.
Because some typesetters and printers may (erroneously) introduce a
hyphen at the end of line when breaking a line, the interpreter of a
URI containing a line break immediately after a hyphen should ignore
all whitespace around the line break, and should be aware
that the hyphen may or may not actually be part of the URI.
</t>
<t>
Using &lt;&gt; angle brackets around each URI is especially recommended as
a delimiting style for a reference that contains embedded whitespace.
</t>
<t>
The prefix "URL:" (with or without a trailing space) was formerly
recommended as a way to help distinguish a URI from other bracketed
designators, though it is not commonly used in practice and is
no longer recommended.
</t>
<t>
For robustness, software that accepts user-typed URI should attempt
to recognize and strip both delimiters and embedded whitespace.
</t>
<figure><preamble>
For example, the text:
</preamble><artwork>
   Yes, Jim, I found it under "http://www.w3.org/Addressing/",
   but you can probably pick it up from &lt;ftp://foo.example.
   com/rfc/&gt;.  Note the warning in &lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/
   ietf/uri/historical.html#WARNING&gt;.
</artwork></figure>
<t>
contains the URI references

<section title="Summary of Non-editorial Changes" anchor="changes">

<section title="Additions" anchor="additions">
<t>
IPv6 (and later) literals have been added to the list of possible identifiers
for the host portion of a authority component, as described by
<xref target="RFC2732"/>, with the addition of "[" and "]" to
the reserved set and a version flag to anticipate future versions of
IP literals.  Square brackets are now specified as reserved within the
authority component and not allowed outside their use as delimiters for
an IP literal within host.  In order to make this change without changing
the technical definition of the path, query, and fragment components,
those rules were redefined to directly specify the characters allowed
rather than be defined in terms of uric.
</t>
<t>
Since <xref target="RFC2732"/> defers to <xref target="RFC3513"/>
for definition of an IPv6 literal address, which unfortunately lacks
an ABNF description of IPv6address, we created a new ABNF rule
for IPv6address that matches the text representations defined by
Section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC3513"/>.  Likewise, the definition
of IPv4address has been improved in order to limit each decimal
octet to the range 0-255.
</t>
<t>
<xref target="comparison">Section 6</xref> on URI normalization and comparison
has been completely rewritten and extended using input from Tim Bray
and discussion within the W3C Technical Architecture Group.
</t>
<t>
An ABNF rule for URI has been introduced to correspond to the
common usage of the term: an absolute URI with optional fragment.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Modifications from RFC 2396" anchor="modifications">
<t>
The ad-hoc BNF syntax has been replaced with the ABNF of
<xref target="RFC2234"/>.  This change required all rule names that
formerly included underscore characters to be renamed with a dash instead.
</t>
<t>
Section 2 on characters has been rewritten to explain what characters
are reserved, when they are reserved, and why they are reserved even
when not used as delimiters by the generic syntax.
The mark characters that are typically unsafe to decode, including
the exclamation mark ("!"), asterisk ("*"), single-quote ("'"), and
open and close parentheses ("(" and ")"), have been moved to the reserved
set in order to clarify the distinction between reserved and unreserved
and hopefully answer the most common question of scheme designers.
Likewise, the section on percent-encoded characters has been rewritten, and
URI normalizers are now given license to decode any percent-encoded octets
corresponding to unreserved characters.  In general, the terms "escaped"
and "unescaped" have been replaced with "percent-encoded" and "decoded",
respectively, to reduce confusion with other forms of escape mechanisms.
</t>
<t>
The ABNF for URI and URI-reference has been redesigned to make them
more friendly to LALR parsers and significantly reduce complexity.
As a result, the layout form of syntax description has been removed,
along with the uric, uric_no_slash, hier_part, opaque_part, net_path,
abs_path, rel_path, path_segments, rel_segment, and mark rules.
All references to "opaque" URIs have been replaced with a better
description of how the path component may be opaque to hierarchy.
The ambiguity regarding the parsing of URI-reference as a URI or a
relative-URI with a colon in the first segment is now explained
and disambiguated in the section defining relative-URI.
</t>
<t>
The fragment identifier has been moved back into the section on
generic syntax components and within the URI and relative-URI
rules, though it remains excluded from absolute-URI.
The number sign ("#") character has been moved back to the reserved set
as a result of reintegrating the fragment syntax.
</t>
<t>
The ABNF has been corrected to allow a relative path to be empty.
This also allows an absolute-URI to consist of nothing after the "scheme:",
as is present in practice with the "dav:" namespace <xref target="RFC2518"/>
and the "about:" scheme used internally by many WWW browser implementations.
The ambiguity regarding the boundary between authority and path
is now explained and disambiguated in the same section.
</t>
<t>
Registry-based naming authorities that use the generic syntax are now
defined within the host rule and limited to 255 path characters.
This change allows current implementations, where whatever name provided
is simply fed to the local name resolution mechanism, to be consistent
with the specification and removes the need to re-specify DNS name
formats here.  It also allows the host component to contain percent-encoded
octets, which is necessary to enable internationalized domain names to be
provided in URIs, processed in their native character encodings at the
application layers above URI processing, and passed to an IDNA library
as a registered name in the UTF-8 character encoding.
The server, hostport, hostname, domainlabel, toplabel, and alphanum
rules have been removed.
</t>
<t>
The resolving relative references algorithm of <xref target="RFC2396"/>
has been rewritten using pseudocode for this revision to improve clarity
and fix the following issues:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
<xref target="RFC2396"/> section 5.2, step 6a, failed to account for
a base URI with no path.
</t>
<t>
Restored the behavior of <xref target="RFC1808"/> where, if the
reference contains an empty path and a defined query component,
then the target URI inherits the base URI's path component.
</t>
<t>
Removed the special-case treatment of same-document references
within the URI parser in favor of a section that explains when a
reference should be interpreted by a dereferencing engine as a
same-document reference: when the target URI and base URI,
excluding fragments, match.  This change does not modify the behavior
of existing same-document references as defined by RFC 2396
(fragment-only references); it merely adds the same-document distinction
to other references that refer to the base URI and simplifies the
interface between applications and their URI parsers, as is consistent with
the internal architecture of deployed URI processing implementations.
</t>
<t>
Separated the path merge routine into two routines: merge, for
describing combination of the base URI path with a relative-path
reference, and remove_dot_segments, for describing how to remove
the special "." and ".." segments from a composed path.  The
remove_dot_segments algorithm is now applied to all URI reference
paths in order to match common implementations and improve the
normalization of URIs in practice.  This change only impacts the
parsing of abnormal references and same-scheme references wherein
the base URI has a non-hierarchical path.
