<dt><a href="lynch93.txt">A Framework for Identifying, Locating, and
    Describing Networked Information Resources</a>,<br>
    Clifford Lynch, March 1993.
<dd>
As networked information resources proliferate on the
Internet, systematic, standard means for identifying,
locating, and describing these resources become increasingly
necessary. While motivations for developing such schemes have
been diverse, there are at least three major classes of
applications that have been driving developments. First, the
library community needs to extend traditional descriptive
catalog practices to networked resources -- in essence, to
permit bibliographic description and control of such
resources in order to incorporate them integrally into
library collections (in the sense that libraries are shifting
from collections to access, and increasingly view their
catalogs and other databases as bibliographies of materials
to which they are prepared to provide, and perhaps subsidize,
access) and to improve access to them. As networked
information resources become critical to scholarship and
research, and come to represent significant investments by
institutions, it also becomes essential to apply the
practices of information management to this new class of
resources.

<dt><a href="rfc1630.txt">Universal Resource Identifiers in WWW:
   A Unifying Syntax for the Expression of Names and Addresses of
   Objects on the Network as used in the World-Wide Web (RFC 1630)</a>,<br>
   T. Berners-Lee, June 1994.
<dd>
   This document defines the syntax used by the World-Wide Web
   initiative to encode the names and addresses of objects on the
   Internet.  The web is considered to include objects accessed using an
   extendable number of protocols, existing, invented for the web
   itself, or to be invented in the future.  Access instructions for an
   individual object under a given protocol are encoded into forms of
   address string.  Other protocols allow the use of object names of
   various forms.  In order to abstract the idea of a generic object,
   the web needs the concepts of the universal set of objects, and of
   the universal set of names or addresses of objects.

<dt><a href="rfc1727.txt">A Vision of an Integrated
    Internet Information Service (RFC 1727)</a>,<br>
    C. Weider, P. Deutsch, December 1994.
<dd>
   This paper lays out a vision of how Internet information services
   might be integrated over the next few years, and discusses in some
   detail what steps will be needed to achieve this integration.
</dd><br>

<dt><a href="rfc1728.txt">Resource Transponders (RFC 1728)</a>,<br>
    C. Weider, 12/16/1994.
<dd>
   Although a number of systems have been created in the last several
   years to provide resource location and navigation on the Internet,
   the information contained in these systems must be maintained and
   updated by hand.  This paper describes an automatic mechanism, the
   resource transponder, for maintaining resource location information.
</dd><br>

<dt><a href="rfc1736.txt">Functional Recommendations for
    Internet Resource Locators (RFC 1736)</a>,<br>
    J. Kunze, February 1995.
<dd>
   This document specifies a minimum set of requirements for Internet
   resource locators, which convey location and access information for
   resources.  Typical examples of resources include network accessible
   documents, WAIS databases, FTP servers, and Telnet destinations.
</dd><br>

<dt><a href="rfc1737.txt">Functional Requirements for
    Uniform Resource Names (RFC 1737)</a>,<br>
    K. Sollins, L. Masinter, December 1994.
<dd>
   This document specifies a minimum set of requirements for a kind of
   Internet resource identifier known as Uniform Resource Names (URNs).
   URNs fit within a larger Internet information architecture, which in
   turn is composed of, additionally, Uniform Resource Characteristics
   (URCs), and Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).  URNs are used for
   identification, URCs for including meta-information, and URLs for
   locating or finding resources.  It is provided as a basis for
   evaluating standards for URNs.  The discussions of this work have
   occurred on the mailing list uri@bunyip.com and at the URI Working
   Group sessions of the IETF.

<dt><a href="rfc1738.txt">Uniform Resource Locators (URL) (RFC 1738)</a>,<br>
    T. Berners-Lee, L. Masinter, M. McCahill, December 1994.
    Updated by RFC 3986.
<dd>
   This document specifies a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), the syntax
   and semantics of formalized information for location and access of
   resources via the Internet.
</dd><br>

<dt><a href="rfc1808.txt">Relative Uniform Resource Locators (RFC 1808)</a>,<br>
    R. Fielding, June 1995, 
    Obsoleted by RFC 3986.
<dd>
   A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a compact representation of the
   location and access method for a resource available via the Internet.
   When embedded within a base document, a URL in its absolute form may
   contain a great deal of information which is already known from the
   context of that base document's retrieval, including the scheme,
   network location, and parts of the url-path.  In situations where the
   base URL is well-defined and known to the parser (human or machine),
   it is useful to be able to embed URL references which inherit that
   context rather than re-specifying it in every instance.  This
   document defines the syntax and semantics for such Relative Uniform
   Resource Locators.
</dd><br>

<dt><a href="rfc1959.txt">An LDAP URL Format (RFC 1959)</a>,<br>
    T. Howes and M. Smith, June 1996.
<dd>
   LDAP is the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, defined in [1] and
   [2].  This document describes a format for an LDAP Uniform Resource
   Locator which will allow Internet clients to have direct access to
   the LDAP protocol.  While LDAP currently is used only as a front end
   to the X.500 directory, the URL format described here is general
   enough to handle the case of stand-alone LDAP servers (i.e., LDAP
   servers not back-ended by X.500).
</dd><br>

<dt><a href="rfc2056.txt">Uniform Resource Locators for Z39.50 (RFC 2056)</a>,<br>
    R. Denenberg, J. Kunze, D. Lynch, November 1996.
<dd>
Z39.50 is an information retrieval protocol that does not fit neatly
into a retrieval model designed primarily around the stateless fetch
of data.  Instead, it models a general user inquiry as a
session-oriented, multi-step task, any step of which may be suspended
temporarily while the server requests additional parameters from the
client before continuing.
</dd><br>

<dt>
  <a href="rfc2111.txt">Content-ID and Message-ID
   Uniform Resource Locators (RFC 2111)</a>,<br>
   E. Levinson, March 1997. Obsoleted by RFC 2392.
<dd>
The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) schemes, "cid:" and "mid:" allow
references to messages and the body parts of messages.  For example,
within a single multipart message, one HTML body part might include
embedded references to other parts of the same message. This document
is a product of the MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate HTML Documents
Working Group of the IETF.
</dd><br>

<dt>
  <a href="rfc2122.txt">VEMMI URL Specification (RFC 2122)</a>,<br>
   D. Mavrakis, H. Layec, K. Kartmann, March 1997.
<dd>
A new URL scheme, "vemmi" is defined. It allows VEMMI client software and 
VEMMI terminals to connect to multimedia interactive services compliant to 
the VEMMI standard (Enhanced Man-Machine Interface for Videotex and 
Multimedia/Hypermedia Information Retrieval Services), sometimes 
abbreviated as "VErsatile MultiMedia Interface".
</dd><br>

<dt>
  <a href="rfc2141.txt">URN Syntax (RFC 2141)</a>,<br>
  R. Moats, May 1997.
<dd>
   Uniform Resource Names (URNs) are intended to serve as persistent,
   location-independent, resource identifiers. This document sets
   forward the canonical syntax for URNs.  A discussion of both existing
   legacy and new namespaces and requirements for URN presentation and
   transmission are presented.  Finally, there is a discussion of URN
   equivalence and how to determine it.
</dd><br>

<dt>
  <a href="rfc2192.txt">IMAP URL Scheme (RFC 2192)</a>,<br>
  C. Newman, September 1997.
<dd>
IMAP [IMAP4] is a rich protocol for accessing remote message stores.
It provides an ideal mechanism for accessing public mailing list
archives as well as private and shared message stores.  This
document defines a URL scheme for referencing objects on an IMAP server.
</dd><br>

<dt>
  <a href="rfc2224.txt">NFS URL Scheme (RFC 2224)</a>,<br>
   B. Callaghan, October 1997.
<dd>
A new URL scheme, 'nfs' is defined.  It is used to refer
to files and directories on NFS servers using the general
URL syntax defined in RFC 1738, "Uniform Resource Locators (URL)".
</dd><br>

<dt><a href="rfc2255.txt">The LDAP URL Format (RFC 2255)</a>,<br>
    LDAP-WG, T. Howes, M. Smith, December 1997,
    Obsoletes <a href="rfc1959.txt">RFC 1959</a>.
<dd>
LDAP is the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, defined in [1], [2]
and [3].  This document describes a format for an LDAP Uniform
Resource Locator.  The format describes an LDAP search operation to
perform to retrieve information from an LDAP directory. This document
replaces RFC 1959. It updates the LDAP URL format for version 3 of
LDAP and clarifies how LDAP URLs are resolved. This document also
defines an extension mechanism for LDAP URLs, so that future documents
can extend their functionality, for example, to provide access to new
LDAPv3 extensions as they are defined.
</dd><br>

<dt>
  <a href="rfc2368.txt">The mailto URL scheme (RFC 2368)</a>,<br>
  P. Hoffman, L. Masinter, J. Zawinski, July 1998.
<dd>
This document defines the format of Uniform Resource Locators (URL)
for designating electronic mail addresses. It is one of a suite of
documents which replace RFC 1738, 'Uniform Resource Locators', and
RFC 1808, 'Relative Uniform Resource Locators'. The syntax of
'mailto' URLs from RFC 1738 is extended to allow creation of more RFC
822 messages by allowing the URL to express additional header and body
fields.
</dd><br>

<dt>
  <a href="rfc2369.txt">The Use of URLs as Meta-Syntax for Core Mail List
Commands and their Transport through Message Header Fields (RFC 2369)</a>,<br>
  G. Neufeld, J. Baer, July 1998.
<dd>
This is a proposal for additional header fields to be added to email
messages sent by email distribution lists. The content of each new
field is typically a URL - usually mailto [RFC2368] - which locates
the relevant information or performs the command directly. MTAs
generating the header fields SHOULD usually include a mailto based
command, in addition to any other protocols used, in order to support
users who do not have access to non-mail-based protocols.
</dd><br>

<dt>
  <a href="rfc2384.txt">POP URL Scheme (RFC 2384)</a>,<br>
  R. Gellens, August 1998.
<dd>
This memo defines a URL scheme for referencing a POP mailbox.
</dd><br>

<dt>
  <a href="rfc2392.txt">Content-ID and Message-ID Uniform Resource Locators
  (RFC 2392)</a>,<br>
   E. Levinson, August 1998.
<dd>
The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) schemes, "cid:" and "mid:" allow
references to messages and the body parts of messages.  For example,
within a single multipart message, one HTML body part might include
embedded references to other parts of the same message.

  <a href="rfc2396.txt">Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax
                        (RFC 2396)</a>,<br>
   T. Berners-Lee, R. Fielding, L. Masinter, August 1998.
   Obsoleted by RFC 3986.<br>
   <a href="rfc2396.xml">XML edition of RFC 2396</a>.<br>
   <a href="rfc2396.html">HTML edition of RFC 2396</a>.
<dd>
   A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact string of characters
   for identifying an abstract or physical resource.  This document
   defines the generic syntax of URI, including both absolute and
   relative forms, and guidelines for their use; it revises and replaces
   the generic definitions in RFC 1738 and RFC 1808.
<p>
   This document defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URI,
   such that an implementation can parse the common components of a URI
   reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
   possible identifier type.  This document does not define a generative
   grammar for URI; that task will be performed by the individual
   specifications of each URI scheme.
</dd><br>

<dt>
   <a href="rfc2397.txt">The "data" URL scheme (RFC 2397)</a>,<br>
   L. Masinter, August 1998. 
<dd>
A new URL scheme, "data", is defined. It allows inclusion of small data 
items as "immediate" data, as if it had been included externally.          
</dd><br>

<dt>
   <a href="rfc2483.txt">URI Resolution Services Necessary for URN Resolution
   (RFC 2483)</a>,<br>
   M. Mealling, R. Daniel, Jr., January 1999. 
<dd>
Retrieving the resource identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier
(URI) [1] is only one of the operations that can be performed on a
URI.  One might also ask for and get a list of other identifiers that
are aliases for the original URI or a bibliographic description of the
resource the URI denotes, for example. This applies to both Uniform
Resource Names (URNs) and Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). Uniform
Resource Characteristics (URCs) are discussed in this document but
only as descriptions of resources rather than identifiers.

          Addresses in URL's (RFC 2732)</a>,<br>
   R. Hinden, B. Carpenter, L. Masinter, December 1999.
   Obsoleted by RFC 3986.
<dd>
This document defines the format for literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's
for implementation in World Wide Web browsers.  This format has been
implemented in the IPv6 versions of several widely deployed browsers
including Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla, and Lynx.  It is also
intended to be used in the IPv6 version of the service location
protocol.
<p>
This document includes an update to the generic syntax for Uniform
Resource Identifiers defined in RFC 2396 [URL].  It defines a syntax
for IPv6 addresses and allows the use of "[" and "]" within a URI
explicitly for this reserved purpose.

   <a href="../test/">Roy Fielding's URI parsing test cases</a>.
<dd>
   A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of
   characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This
   specification defines the generic URI syntax and a process for
   resolving URI references that might be in relative form, along with
   guidelines and security considerations for the use of URIs on the
   Internet.  The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all
   valid URIs, allowing an implementation to parse the common components
   of a URI reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements
   of every possible identifier.  This specification does not define a
   generative grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual
   specifications of each URI scheme.

<dt>
  <a href="rfc3987.txt">Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)
                        (RFC 3987)</a>,<br>
   M. D&uuml;rst and M. Suignard, January 2005.
<dd>
   This document defines a new protocol element, the Internationalized
   Resource Identifier (IRI), as a complement to the Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI).  An IRI is a sequence of characters from the
   Universal Character Set (Unicode/ISO 10646).  A mapping from IRIs to
   URIs is defined, which means that IRIs can be used instead of URIs,
   where appropriate, to identify resources.<br>
<br>
   The approach of defining a new protocol element was chosen instead of
   extending or changing the definition of URIs.  This was done in order
   to allow a clear distinction and to avoid incompatibilities with
   existing software.  Guidelines are provided for the use and
   deployment of IRIs in various protocols, formats, and software
   components that currently deal with URIs.
