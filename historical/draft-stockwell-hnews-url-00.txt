Abstract

HNEWS [1] is an HTTP-tunneling variant of the NNTP news protocol.  
This document defines the format of Uniform Resource Locators(URLs) 
identifying news messages and groups provided by HNEWS servers.  
The syntax of 'hnews' URLs is designed to be compatible with the 
current common usage of the 'news' URL scheme.  Specifically, the 
'hnews' URL scheme is designed according to recommendations made in 
[NEWS_URL_SCHEME].  [NEWS_URL_SCHEME] is based on the general 
specification of all URL schemes in "Uniform Resource Locators (URL): 
Generic Syntax and Semantics" [RFC URI SYNTAX].

1. The 'hnews' URL scheme

The hnews URL scheme is used to designate a message or a set of
messages available from an HNEWS server.  The hnews URL scheme is 
meant to designate the same kinds of objects as the 'news' URL 
scheme except that 'hnews' objects are retrieved using the HNEWS 
protocol instead of the USENET news protocol used to retrieve 
'news' objects.

Therefore, the syntax of the 'hnews' URL scheme is hereby declared 
to be EXACTLY the same as the 'news' URL scheme except that 'hnews' 
URLs begin with the scheme designator "hnews" instead of the scheme 
designator "news".  
The semanatics of the 'hnews' URL scheme is hereby declared to be 
EXACTLY the same as the 'news' URL scheme except that objects 
referenced by 'hnews' URLs are retrieved with the HNEWS protocol 
defined in [1] instead of the USENET news protocol used to retrieve
objects referenced by 'news' URLs.
The default port (in server) of 'hnews' URLs is 80.

See [NEWS_URL_SCHEME] for a description of the 'news' URL scheme. 
If the syntax or semantics of the 'news' URL scheme should be changed 
by future documents published by the IETF then those future documents 
also change the syntax or semantics of the 'hnews' URL scheme.


2. Examples

An URL to read a newsgroup from anywhere (usually locally):

    <hnews:alt.adoptive.parenting>

An URL to read a specific message from anywhere (usually locally):

    <hnews:EFGJG4.7A@deshaw.com>

An URL to read a specific message from a designated site, using port 
8080 instead of the default port of 80:

    <hnews://java.sun.com:8080/servlet/NewsServlet/5rb1or$67v@news.jumpnet.com>

An URL to read a newsgroup from a designated site:

    <hnews://www.microsoft.com/cgi-bin/news/misc.transport.air-industry.cargo>

An URL to read all the newsgroups from a designated site:
Notice that the server name has multiple slashes in it.
We know that no message number or message id is specified because the 
URL ends with a slash.  URLs that include a message number or ID will 
never end with a slash.

    <hnews://www.adenine.c.dna.affrc.go.jp/cgi-bin/news/>
