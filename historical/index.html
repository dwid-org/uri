<a name="WARNING">The following Expired Drafts may be useful for
looking back at what has been discussed in the past, but most of the
technical content has been adopted (and hopefully improved)
by later RFCs, abandoned in favor of other solutions, or simply
ignored due to lack of implementations or developer interest.
Their appearance here does not reflect their technical relevance,
good or bad; be sure to look at the published RFCs first.</a>

  <b>"Mailserver URL Specification"</b>, Paul E. Hoffman, 07 Jul 1995.
   <A HREF="draft-ietf-uri-url-mailserver-02.txt">
   &lt;draft-ietf-uri-url-mailserver-02.txt&gt;</A>
<dd>
   A new URL scheme, "mailserver", is defined. It allows mail client
   software to create RFC822 mail messages from a URL.

  <b>"Uniform Resource Names, ISO OIDs and DNS"</b>,

  <A HREF="draft-mealling-oid-dns-00.txt">
       &lt;draft-mealling-oid-dns-00.txt&gt;</A>
<dd>
This paper describes a "resolution-mechanism"-independent architecture for 
Uniform Resource Name (URN) usage and name space management.  This 
non-monolithic architecture allows different components of the name space 
to be managed by the appropriate level of network authority.  This not only
integrates well with traditional Internet models, it allows flexibility in 
choice of implementation of support for each layer of the name space.      
An implementation for the architecture, using OIDs and DNS-based 
infrastructure, is outlined.

  <b>"A Critique of Existing URN Proposals"</b>,
  M. Madsen, 22 Aug 1995, 
  <A HREF="draft-ietf-uri-urn-madsen-critique-00.txt">
       &lt;draft-ietf-uri-urn-madsen-critique-00.txt&gt;</A>
<dd>
This document criticises existing URN (Uniform Resource Name) proposals in 
the light of generality, extensibility, and general futureproofing.  The 
idea is to draw upon the best characteristics of the existing proposals so 
as to converge on an acceptably functional and nonrestrictive draft 
specification for both URN syntax and resolution schemes.

  <b>"How Roy would Implement URNs and URCs Today"</b>,
  R. Fielding, 07 Jul 1995, 
  <A HREF="draft-ietf-uri-roy-urn-urc-00.txt">
       &lt;draft-ietf-uri-roy-urn-urc-00.txt&gt;</A>
<dd>
   This document describes how the author would implement Uniform
   Resource Names (URNs) and Uniform Resource Characteristics (URCs),
   such that the basic concepts and technology can be usable by today's
   World-Wide Web clients and servers.  It is intended to identify the
   key ingredients which make the WWW extensible and open to the
   introduction of URNs and URCs, and thereby steer the implementors
   of URI technology toward more consistent solutions.

  <b>"Issues Concerning URN Assignment and Resolution"</b>,
  S. Browne, K. Moore, 07 Jul 1995, 
  <A HREF="draft-ietf-uri-urn-issues-00.txt">
       &lt;draft-ietf-uri-urn-issues-00.txt&gt;</A>
<dd>
     A number of schemes have been proposed over the past year or so for
assigning and resolving Uniform Resource Names (URNs) and for associating
meta-information with URNs.  The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
Working Group is currently faced with the task of evaluating these
schemes.  The schemes all claim to satisfy the functional requirements
for URNs stated in RFC 1737.  A number of additional issues that will be
helpful to consider for purposes of evaluation are listed and discussed
in this draft.  Although this draft is long on questions and short on
answers, it attempts to distill the issues on which consensus (even if
it's agreement to disagree) needs to be reached before progress on
standardization can be made.

  <b>"Location-Independent URLs /or/ URNs considered harmful"</b>,
  K. Moore, 07 Jul 1995, 
  <A HREF="draft-ietf-uri-urns-harmful-00.txt">
       &lt;draft-ietf-uri-urns-harmful-00.txt&gt;</A>
<dd>
This document describes a means by which location-independent access to
resources can be provided, without creating a new class of resource
names.  Instead, a resolution service is proposed for existing URLs,
which allows information providers to advertise meta-information about a
resource named by a URL, and/or alternate locations from which that par-
ticular resource might be accessed.<P>
 
Depending on your point of view, the approach described in this document
might be taken as one or more of: (a) an alternative solution to the
"URL problem", (b) a strategy for gradual transition from URLs to URNs,
or (c) a worst-case scenario in the event that URN adoption takes too long.

  <b>"Thoughts on Standardizing URN Resolution Protocols"</b>,
  K. Sollins, 26 Jun 1995, 
  <A HREF="draft-ietf-uri-urn-res-thoughts-00.txt">
       &lt;draft-ietf-uri-urn-res-thoughts-00.txt&gt;</A>
<dd>
The problem of standardizing URN resolution needs to be thought through 
carefully.  If we partition the problem of name resolution, it becomes 
clearer that the user to resolution service interaction should be 
standardized.  In contrast, in order to support a variety of models, 
behaviors, and other policies for name resolution services, we must allow 
for a multiplicity of such services, each perhaps requiring a different 
protocol between its servers.  The URI group can still limit its efforts, 
but should support more than one such service as a proof of concept that 
multiple service types can be supported.

  <STRONG>"The Handle System"</STRONG>,<BR>
   W. Arms, D. Ely, 20 Aug 1996.
   <A HREF="draft-ietf-uri-urn-handles-00.txt">
        &lt;draft-ietf-uri-urn-handles-00.txt&gt;</A>
<dd>
The Handle System provides identifiers for digital objects
and other resources in distributed computer systems.  These
identifiers are known as handles.  The system ensures that
handles are unique and that they can be retained over long
time periods.   Since the system makes no assumptions about
the characteristics of the items that are identified, handles
can be used in a wide variety of systems and applications.<P>
 
The handle system has the following components:  naming
authorities, handle generators, the global handle server,
local handle servers, caching handle servers, client software
libraries, proxy servers, and administrative tools.  For
reasons of performance and availability, the global, local,
and caching servers are implemented as distributed systems
comprising many server computers.  All components, except the
local handle server, have been implemented and are available
for general use by the research community.<P>
 
The handle system provides all the capabilities listed in RFC
1737, K. Sollins, L. Masinter, "Functional Requirements for
Uniform Resource Names", 12/20/1994.

  <b>"URN Services"</b>, K. Shafer, E. Miller, V. Tkac, S. Weibel, 29 Jun 1995, 
  <A HREF="draft-ietf-uri-urn-resolution-01.txt">
       &lt;draft-ietf-uri-urn-resolution-01.txt&gt;</A>
<dd>
This document focuses on the syntax and function of URNs, the nature of 
registered and unregistered naming authorities, and the relationships of 
URNs to an open-ended variety of resolution services that might link these 
objects within the URI architecture.

  <b>"The Path URN Specification"</b>,
  Daniel LaLiberte, Michael Shapiro, 27 Jul 1995, 
  <A HREF="draft-ietf-uri-urn-path-01.txt">
       &lt;draft-ietf-uri-urn-path-01.txt&gt;</A>
<dd>
A new "path" URN scheme is proposed that defines a uniformly hierarchical 
name space. This URN scheme supports dynamic relocation and replication of 
resources. Existing DNS technology is used to resolve a path into sets of 
equivalent URLs, and then one URL is resolved into the named resource.

  <b>"An SGML-based URC Service"</b>, R. Daniel, T. Allen, 16 Jun 1995, 
  <A HREF="draft-ietf-uri-urc-sgml-00.txt">
  &lt;draft-ietf-uri-urc-sgml-00.txt&gt;</A>
<dd>
The URI Working Group has been developing an architecture where
Internet resources are identified using a Uniform Resource Name (URN),
and retrieved using a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). Mapping URNs to
URLs is the job of the Uniform Resource Characteristics (URC) service,
whose requirements were given in [1].  This paper presents one
possible specification for the URC service.  This spec provides the
means for the URC service to formally specify new capabilities, while
retaining the speed that is paramount to the fundamental use of the
URC service as the means for URN to URL resolution.

<dd>
    In this paper, the author proposes a set of requirments for a Uniform 
    Resource Characteristic which is designed to provide a method for 
    encapsulating meta-information about a given Uniform Resource Name or 
    Uniform Resource Location.

<dd>
This document defines a syntax for URNs, and operational rules for their 
assignment and usage. The intent is to provide enough information for 
implementors of IIIR systems to use these in their work.

<dd>
    This document is intended to address the issue of URN to URC resolution
    at a level between the IIIR Vision document [clw/peterd:1] and the 
    various standards documents such as the URL specification. [timb]. This
    document is also intended to act as some pointers for people who might 
    want to implement URNs in information systems they are building.

  <b>"Encoding and Use of Uniform Resource Characteristics"</b>, M. Mealling, 
  06 Jul 1994,
  <A HREF="draft-ietf-uri-urc-spec-00.txt">&lt;draft-ietf-uri-urc-spec-00.txt&gt;</A>
<dd>
    This document describes a Uniform Resource Characteristic, a method for
    encoding information about a given network resource. This information 
    is called meta-information since it is not information that is actually
    found in the resource itself. The design of this Uniform Resource 
    Characteristic was driven by the set of design requirements as 
    specified in the "Specification of Uniform Resource Characteristics" 
    Internet draft [Mealling 94]. The method of encoding is based on the 
    simple use of attribute/value pairs utilized in several existing 
    network systems including RFC822 e-mail headers, IAFA templates, and 
    the draft whois++ system [Deutsch 94]. In addition to the 
    specification, several examples are provided which illustrate complex 
    information encoding and actual client/server using whois++ as the 
    protocol.

   &lt;draft-ietf-uri-urn-res-descript-00.txt&gt;</A>
<dd>
This document gives an overview of how Uniform Resource Names (URNs) will
be resolved. It describes how different URN resolution schemes will fit
together, the requirements for the multiple URN schemes, expectations for
URN clients, and other general resolution issues.<P>

This document does not cover any specific resolution schemes, the syntax
for URNs, or the format of resolution results. It is expected that these
issues (and other URN-related topics) will be covered in different Internet
Drafts submitted to the IETF URI Working Group.

This document defines the syntax for Uniform Resource Names (URNs). This
syntax is basically the same as the URN syntax described in RFC 1630.<P>

This document does not cover any specific resolution schemes or the format
of resolution results. It is expected that these issues (and other
URN-related topics) will be covered in different Internet Drafts submitted

   <A HREF="draft-ietf-uri-urn-x-dns-2-00.txt">
   &lt;draft-ietf-uri-urn-x-dns-2-00.txt&gt;</A>
<dd>
This document defines a scheme for resolving Uniform Resource Names (URNs)
using the domain name system. The scheme, called x-dns-2, allows URN
publishers to create URN resolvers without central registration, and
without changing or adding any domain names.

   <A HREF="draft-ietf-uri-urc-trivial-00.txt">
   &lt;draft-ietf-uri-urc-trivial-00.txt&gt;</A>
<dd>
This document defines a trivial, machine-parsable Uniform Resource
Citiation (URC) syntax that can be returned from the resolution of Uniform
Resource Names (URNs). The syntax, called urc0, is also appropriate for any
program that can return URCs. More sophisticated URC schemes will be
developed later. urc0 is intended to be the simplest possible
machine-parsable representation of a URC.<P>

This document does not cover any specific resolution schemes or the syntax
for URNs. It is expected that these issues (and other URN-related topics)
will be covered in different Internet Drafts submitted to the IETF URI

This draft describes the place of the Uniform Resource Characteristic (URC)
service within the overall context of Uniform Resource Identification on  
the Internet.  It presents several scenarios illustrating how the  URC 
service might be used.  From these  usage scenarios, we derive a set of 
requirements that any proposed URC services must meet.
