their contributions are intended as both an [IETF Contribution](#note-well)

Contributions that are in the public domain remain in the public domain
regardless of their incorporation in other works.

The [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE) is the downstream license for all files

## Following Discussion

Contributors have a few venues for discussion:

* The [URI mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/) is used for
  announcements, general discussion of drafts, and contributions that
  (for whatever reason) are not submitted via GitHub.

* Meetings (if any) are informal and typically held in conjunction with an
  [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) or [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) meeting.

* Specific issues and pull requests are discussed using this repository's
  [Github collaboration tools](https://github.com/dwid-org/uri/).


## Raising Issues

Before filing a new issue, please consider a few things:

* Review the existing issues first to avoid filing a duplicate.
* Only raise issues with regard to the specification(s),
  **not to ask questions or make support requests**.
* If you're not sure how to phrase your issue, please ask on the
  [mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/).

Issues can also be raised via email to the list by clearly marking them
as such (e.g., "New Issue" in the `Subject:` line).

Be aware that the editors might rephrase, change scope, split, or
combine issues, depending on how the work seems to be progressing.
If you feel that such a change loses an important part of your
original issue, please bring that up in comments or on the list.

Off-topic and duplicate issues will be closed without discussion.
Note that comments on individual git commits will only be responded
to with best effort, and may not be seen.


## Resolving Issues

Issues will be labeled by the editors as either 
[`editorial`](https://github.com/dwid-org/uri/labels/editorial) or
[`design`](https://github.com/dwid-org/uri/labels/design):

* **Editorial** issues can be dealt with by the editor(s) without consensus or
  notification. Typically, any discussion will take place on the issue itself.

* **Design** issues require discussion before they can be labeled resolved
  and closed.

Open design issues can be discussed on the mailing list or the issues list.
The editors can also propose resolutions to design issues for the group's
consideration by incorporating them into the draft(s). Additional labels
are used to indicate when an issue 
[`needs-discussion`](https://github.com/dwid-org/uri/labels/needs-discussion),
[`has-proposal`](https://github.com/dwid-org/uri/labels/has-proposal), is
[`editor-ready`](https://github.com/dwid-org/uri/labels/editor-ready),
[`incorporated`](https://github.com/dwid-org/uri/labels/incorporated), or
[`has-consensus`](https://github.com/dwid-org/uri/labels/has-consensus).

Closed design issues are believed to be not worth further discussion.
This could be because they have already been resolved in the drafts,
a decision has been made not to resolve them, they are invalid or a
duplicate of other issues, or simply not applicable to the current work.

If you have a question or problem with an issue in the `closed` state,
please comment on it (either in the issues list or mailing list) and
the editors might adjust its state accordingly. Reopening issues that
have been labeled as `has-consensus` requires new information.


## Pull Requests

We welcome pull requests, both for editorial suggestions and to resolve open issues.
Please include the relevant issue #number within the pull request.

Please do not use a pull request to open a new design issue; it may not be noticed.


## Code of Conduct

The [IETF Guidelines for Conduct](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7154) applies
to all of our communications and meetings.


## NOTE WELL

Any submission to the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) intended by the
Contributor for publication as all or part of an IETF Internet-Draft or
RFC and any statement made within the context of an IETF activity is
considered an "IETF Contribution". Such statements include oral
statements in IETF sessions, as well as written and electronic
communications made at any time or place, which are addressed to:

 * The IETF plenary session
 * The IESG, or any member thereof on behalf of the IESG
 * Any IETF mailing list, including the IETF list itself, any working group
   or design team list, or any other list functioning under IETF auspices
 * Any IETF working group or portion thereof
 * Any Birds of a Feather (BOF) session
 * The IAB or any member thereof on behalf of the IAB
 * The RFC Editor or the Internet-Drafts function
 * All IETF Contributions are subject to the rules of
   [RFC 5378](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5378) and
   [RFC 3979](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3979)
   (updated by [RFC 4879](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4879)).

Statements made outside of an IETF session, mailing list or other function,
that are clearly not intended to be input to an IETF activity, group or
function, are not IETF Contributions in the context of this notice.

Please consult [RFC 5378](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5378) and
[RFC 3979](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3979) for details.

A participant in any IETF activity is deemed to accept all IETF rules of
