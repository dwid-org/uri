Two modifications to the URI working group agenda:

First, we've been informed that:

> I wanted to let you know that on Monday morning we're going to need to
> separate the ballroom into three sections to accommodate the multicast
> breakouts, etc.  URI will be meeting in one of those rooms.  At 0930
> awhen the plenary sessions ends the hotel will be pulling the airwalls
> to create the three sections.  There will be a delay in the start time
> of the sessions.  We're hoping no more than 15 minutes.

Second:

Bill Arms of CNRI will be talking about the CS-TR 'handle' service as
a possible URN system.

Thus, we have a compressed schedule for talking about URNs on Monday.
I've left open the possibility that we'll want as a group to continue
URN discussion on Tuesday at the expense of cutting into some URC work.

I urge all of the presenters to keep their presentation brief, and for
us to save discussion until we've heard all of the presentations.
I've arbitrarily allocated 15 minutes to each document for the
author(s) to review the document's highlights; this is negotiable
(in advance) of course.
